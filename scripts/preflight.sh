# WHY THIS EXISTS. The evidence in this repository is only worth what a reader can
# regenerate, and every failure this script tests for has actually happened on a developer
# box here - each one silently, and each one producing either a demo that stops halfway or,
# worse, one that skips a section and still exits zero. A judge running the demo for the
# first time should find out about a missing dependency from a line that names the fix, not
# from a table that quietly has fewer rows than the README promised.
#
# It distinguishes two severities and nothing else:
#
#   BLOCKER   nothing can run until this is fixed
#   DEGRADED  the demo runs but a specific section will be missing, named here
#
# Exit status is 1 only for blockers, so this is safe to run at the top of a pipeline that
# should still proceed on a machine without, say, highspy.
#
# Usage: scripts/preflight.sh [--quiet]
