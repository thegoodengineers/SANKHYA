| 2 | MPS/LP readers, revised primal simplex, CLI | **done** |
| 3 | Verification spine: rational oracle, independent checker, Netlib harness | **done** |
| 4 | Restarted PDHG - **CPU done**, its answer finished by the interior point by default since #229; CUDA backend on `main` (`src/gpu/`, #329 to #373), measured by #390 on an RTX 5050 (`bench/results/gpu-a4f02b1.csv`, `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` section 1g): slower than the CPU up to 5,000 x 5,000, 1.63x faster at 10,000 x 10,000 at 1e-4, PDHG alone on synthetic KKT LPs | done, measured on one card |
| 5 | Branch & bound → MILP | **done** (MIPLIB benchmarked; root cuts landed in #159 and are off by default, see below) |
| 6–10 | Performance, branch & cut, IPM/QP, robustness, packaging | convex QP **done** (Phase 8, `src/qp/`); interior point **done, opt-in** (`src/ipm/`, no basis); robustness sweep **done** (`bench/runners/robustness.py`); root cuts **done, off by default** (#159, `src/mip/cuts.cpp`); machine-checkable certificates for infeasible and unbounded models **done** (#192, `src/core/certificate.cpp`, checked by `tools/verify_solution.py`); MIP gap targets **done** (#188); packaging **done** apart from the human items on #73 |

LP is solved by a bounded-variable revised primal simplex (or restarted PDHG), MILP by
branch and bound, and convex QP by a Condat-Vu primal-dual method — and MIQP by branch and
bound over QP relaxations — all end to end from an MPS file through to an independently
verified answer. **Non-convex** QP is the one class still refused, and refused deliberately
rather than approximated: it is decided by an LDL^T semidefiniteness test before any
arithmetic starts, and a negative pivot is returned as the certificate. Reporting a local
optimum as a global one is the single most damaging thing this dispatcher could do, so it
does not — see the Evidence rules in [`ENGINEERING_RULES.md`](ENGINEERING_RULES.md).

Benchmark results against Netlib, headline first: **80 of 89** on the full set — matched
to the published optimum to a relative 1e-6 *and* passed independent verification —
measured on `main` at `adb37bb` (`bench/results/netlib-full-adb37bb.csv`, alone on the
machine, on mains; the same 80 and the same nine as `netlib-full-b3f1660.csv` and
`netlib-full-e134aeb.csv` before it, across the dual ratio test's relative pivot floor
(#244) and the engine selection rule table (#284)). The narrower
tiers read higher (**48 of 50** on the medium tier, **9 of 9** on the small set the demo
runs) because both are defined by a row cap, which makes them the easier half by
construction; the full set is the number Phase 6's ">= 95% of Netlib" criterion is
measured against, so it is the one quoted here. See
[`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`](docs/BENCHMARKS.md), generated from the CSVs in `bench/results/` so
it cannot drift.

The 9 non-passes are worth naming, and eight of them are not wrong answers. Every one that
produces an answer was cross-checked against **HiGHS**, a mature third-party solver run as a
separate process, by `bench/runners/cross_check_highs.py`
(`bench/results/cross-check-highs-6bec31e.csv`):

| what it is | count | instances |
|---|---|---|
| our answer verifies as optimal and agrees with HiGHS; Netlib's published table is the outlier (`e226` by its objective constant, `pilot` by 1.5e-04, the rest by up to 1.3e-03) | **8** | `80bau3b`, `e226`, `ganges`, `greenbea`, `greenbeb`, `nesm`, `pilot`, `scrs8` |
| ran out of time at 120 s: the scaled attempt's share of the clock ends inside a basis factorization, which is abandoned, and the unscaled retry does not finish either (#214, #247) | **1** | `maros-r7` |

So: **on every Netlib instance where this solver produces a final answer, that answer
agrees with HiGHS** - nine of the twelve rows in that CSV agree to 3.0e-07 or better; the
three that differ there are `dfl001` and `pilot87`, unfinished iterates in that run and
optimal in this one (below), and `maros-r7`, which has no answer in either. What remains
is one instance without an answer.

The machine's speed state is part of the evidence, so it is stated. The two rows that
moved from 78 to 80 are the two the clock used to decide: `pilot87` now reaches its
optimum in 62.6 s (44,485 iterations, through the unscaled retry after the scaled attempt
stops) where it needed more than the 120 s at `2b4eb6b` and 55.9 s on a cooler run at
`6bec31e`, and `dfl001` reaches its optimum in 116.0 s (48,988 iterations, the same route)
where it was truncated at 120 s in every earlier run. What changed between the two runs is
the dual simplex's cost per iteration (#242, #265, #278), not the answers: the 78 rows
that passed before pass now with the same status. `dfl001` at 116 s of 120 is still
clock-decided, and a slower machine may lose it again; the table above says which
machine state it came from.

This mattered because our own verifier could not settle it — it re-derives the answer from
the same file we read, so agreeing with it shows only that our two readers agree, and both
were written by this project (#75). Two independent solvers landing on the same number is a
different order of evidence. The pass rate above is still measured against Netlib's table,
unchanged: a project cannot grade itself against a solver of its own choosing.

The failure class that *was* the largest is gone from Netlib. `basis became singular` was
13 of 23 failures at `7b6b5c2` (`bench/results/netlib-full-7b6b5c2.csv`, 2026-08-31) and
has been **zero on the full Netlib set** since #144 found the pivot search treating "none
of my first four candidates was admissible" as proof of singularity and #147 repaired the
genuine rank defects that remained. It is not zero everywhere: on Mittelmann's `qap15` the
unscaled retry went singular at iteration 13,954 (`bench/results/mittelmann-64d1a6d.csv`,
issue #174), the first reappearance in the evidence and on the Mittelmann instance closest
to Netlib's size. Since then the dual simplex became the automatic engine (#165),
reliability branching landed (#166), presolve's postsolve runs its dual passes to a fixed
point (#162), and the FTRAN went hyper-sparse (#169): between them the full set went from
71 to 78 verified passes, and `degen3`, which took 123.6 s, takes 0.9 s
(`bench/results/netlib-full-2b4eb6b.csv`); the iteration-cost work of #242, #265 and #278
took it to 80 (`bench/results/netlib-full-e134aeb.csv`), and the relative pivot floor of
#244 kept it at 80 with the handovers to the primal loop down from 22 to 15 and `dfl001`
finishing inside the scaled attempt (`bench/results/netlib-full-b3f1660.csv`).

That is a better class of problem to have, and a different roadmap: speed at size rather
than robustness. Tracked in #214 (`maros-r7`, the one non-pass that is ours to fix) and,
for the scale families, #279.

MIPLIB 2017 is benchmarked too: **14 of 30** easy instances reach the published optimum,
**9 of 30** also prove it with the shipped defaults (`bench/results/miplib-078cb24.csv`,
60 s, on `main`; the same 14 and 9 as `miplib-b3f1660.csv` after presolve
started running on MILPs (#301) - `neos-3611689-kaihu` is the one that moved, 120 to the
published 119, still unproved; at 600 s the same set reaches 15 and still proves 9
(`bench/results/miplib-600s-cca77e0.csv`): no instance needed only time, six have the
optimum in hand and cannot close the bound, and fifteen never find it, which is #221 and
#290 respectively. It was 13 and 9 at `bf3df02`, and 6 proved at
`2b4eb6b`, before #188 let a search that meets its gap target say `optimal` - three of the
nine are that renamed status, not a better search) - branch and bound has reliability
branching, warm-started node LPs, conflict analysis (#292, off by default), a parallel tree
search (`--option mip_threads=N`, #403) and cutting planes that are off by default. The
three-way A/B at `078cb24` (`bench/results/miplib-cuts-{off,on,tree}.csv`,
`docs/BENCHMARKS.md` section 2) is the first in which cuts gain a proof: a root round alone
reaches 13 and proves 9 at **1.049x** the nodes, losing `neos-3611689-kaihu` at the limit,
while root **plus tree rounds** reach 14 and prove **10** at 0.920x, `neos-3611689-kaihu`
proved. A round that costs nodes is the signature of taking every violated cut rather than
a scored few, which is #415. Either way the search finds good incumbents far more often
than it closes the bound. For
scale beyond what Netlib tests, `bench/runners/generate_large_lp.py` builds sparse LPs of
any size with an exactly known analytic optimum, and `bench/runners/mittelmann.py` runs
Mittelmann's LP set: on its eight smallest instances (6,330 to 376,500 rows) the result is
**0 of 8** for the default dual simplex inside 300 s - eight time limits, now that `qap15`
no longer ends in a singular basis (#174, fixed in #178) - every one named in section 1d of
`docs/BENCHMARKS.md` (`bench/results/mittelmann-e134aeb.csv`, run on `main`, on AC, alone
on the machine). The same eight under the other two engines (#216): the first-order engine
finishes and verifies **2 of 8**, `chromaticindex1024-7` in 1.2 s and `brazil3` in 127 s
(`bench/results/mittelmann-pdhg-d24662f.csv`); the interior point finishes none, dies of
`std::bad_alloc` on two and goes non-finite on two (`mittelmann-ipm-d24662f.csv`; #246).
The overrun on `bdry2`, whose time limit could not reach inside the sparse LU (#208), is
gone for the simplex: 303 s against 300, where it was 380 and before that 648.

## Reproduce everything

One command takes a fresh clone to every claim on this page - build, tests, the Netlib
benchmark with independent verification, the HiGHS comparison, and the full PS26119
walkthrough:

```bash
scripts/reproduce.sh
```

It runs **offline**: the Netlib instances it benchmarks are committed, with their published
optima. Add `--fetch-medium` to also download and run the 50-instance medium tier; the
full 89-instance set, where the headline number above comes from, is
`bench/runners/fetch_data.py --set full` followed by
`bench/runners/netlib.py --time-limit 120`. Any step that cannot run on your machine prints why and is
listed again in the summary, so a shorter run is never mistaken for a passing one.

To check the machine without running anything:

```bash
scripts/preflight.sh
```

It names the two things that most often go wrong quietly - a `python3` that is the Microsoft
Store stub, and Windows Smart App Control refusing to execute a freshly linked binary - and
prints the fix for each.

## Build

Requires CMake 3.20+, Ninja, and a C++20 compiler (GCC 10+ / Clang 12+ / MSVC 19.30+).

```bash
scripts/configure.sh build Release
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

`scripts/configure.sh` picks a C++20-capable compiler rather than trusting PATH order,
which matters on Windows boxes carrying an old MinGW. It also reuses dependency sources
from any build tree already on disk, so a second build directory costs seconds rather than
re-cloning 200 MB. `ctest --test-dir build` runs the whole suite and prints its own count;
the count is not typed here, because a typed count goes stale the day a test is added.

## Use

```bash
./build/sankhya version
./build/sankhya options
./build/sankhya engines
./build/sankhya info  demo/crude_blend.mps
./build/sankhya solve demo/crude_blend.mps --write-sol blend.sol --stats blend.json
./build/sankhya solve demo/crude_blend.mps --progress-out progress.jsonl
```

`demo/crude_blend.mps` is a small crude-blending LP: three crudes into a diesel pool, with a
CDU throughput window, a diesel commitment and a sulphur specification. It ships as both MPS
and LP so the two readers can be checked against each other, and it exercises the format
features most likely to be misread - a `RANGES` entry on a `G` row, an equality row,
`OBJSENSE MAX`, and `LO`/`UP` bounds.

`sankhya diagnose` answers "what am I about to solve?" before committing to it: size, the
mix of row and column kinds, sparsity, the coefficient magnitude spread with a scaling-risk
verdict, the problem class (and, for a QP, the convexity test's own answer), what presolve
would remove, and which engine the solver would pick and why. `--format json` for a script.
It reports no solve-time or node-count estimate, because there is no honest way to produce one
before the solve.

```bash
./build/sankhya diagnose demo/crude_blend.mps
./build/sankhya diagnose model.mps --format json
```

`sankhya engines` lists every engine in the build: the classes it solves, how it is reached
(`algorithm=<name>`, `algorithm=pdhg` with `--gpu`, or the problem class alone), what its
answer carries, and where it lives; `--format json` for a script. Every flag is read from
the engine's own declaration (#297), so the list cannot say something the solver does not do.

`solve` returns a meaningful exit code: `0` optimal, `1` a limit or a proven
infeasible/unbounded model, `3` the file could not be read, `5` a numerical or model error.

Beyond the objective, the solution file carries the **shadow price of every row**. On the
blending model those are the numbers a refinery planner acts on: what one more unit of
diesel commitment costs, and what the sulphur specification is worth.

A verdict of *infeasible* or *unbounded* is not taken on trust either. Since #192 the
solution file carries a **certificate** with it - a Farkas vector for an infeasible model, a
ray for an unbounded one - and `tools/verify_solution.py`, which shares no code with the
solver, checks the certificate against the original model the same way it checks an
optimal point. The header says `certificate farkas`, `ray` or `none`, so a verdict that
arrives without one (a model presolve proved infeasible, say) is visible as such.

A MILP stopped by a gap target (`--option mip_relative_gap=0.01`) reports *optimal within
the gap* and the file records the gap it was asked for (#188); a run that stops on a limit
reports the incumbent as what it is. Time limits reach inside the sparse LDL^T factorization
(#197), so an interior-point solve on a model whose factor is too large stops on time
rather than when the factorization happens to finish; the sparse LU used by the simplex
does not yet honour it the same way (#208).

A MILP also reports a **solution pool** (#225): up to `pool_size` (default 10) integer plans
the search found, each a different integer assignment, the solution first and the rest best
first, written to the `.sol` file's `pool` section (integer columns only) and checked by
`tools/verify_solution.py`. By default it is what the ordinary search happened to find, and
the search is unchanged; `--option pool_complete=true` keeps searching until the pool
provably holds the best plans, at the cost of nodes, and `pool_diversity` / `pool_gap` shape
which ones. The demo's production-planning scene prints the top three.

`--progress-out` appends one JSON line per logged iteration or node to a file as the solve
runs, flushed immediately - an operator can `tail -f` it during a long solve to watch the
bound close in on the answer without waiting for the final report.

The solver supports graceful interruption. Pressing Ctrl-C (`SIGINT`) in the CLI stops the solve at the next safe point and returns the best found point as an `interrupted` result. The Python bindings expose `Model.interrupt()` and support progress callbacks; returning a non-zero value from a Python callback (or via `sankhya_set_callback` in C) interrupts the solve gracefully.

## Demo

```bash
demo/run_sih_demo.sh         # the full PS26119 walkthrough, in the problem statement's order
demo/run_demo.sh --list      # or pick a single instance
demo/run_demo.sh share2b     # solve it live, then verify it independently
```

The nine Netlib instances are committed, so the demo needs no network. Every number it prints
comes from a command it just ran.

Both scripts take the first binary they find, and `build/` is first on that list, so a
`build/` left from an earlier commit would run and answer as *that* commit's solver with
nothing on screen to say so - measured here as six of nine instances reporting
`verifier: REJECTED` from a binary ten days old, where one built from the tree passed all
nine. Since #410 they say so above the first result, `scripts/preflight.sh` reports it
beside its Smart App Control check, and `scripts/binary_provenance.sh build/sankhya.exe`
answers the question on its own.

On Windows, run it as `PYTHON=python demo/run_sih_demo.sh` if `python3` on your PATH is the
Microsoft Store stub; `scripts/preflight.sh` tells you whether it is.

## What this does NOT do

Stated here rather than only in the demo, because a solver that is vague about its limits is
not one an industrial user can plan around. [Issue #54](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/54)
tracks every PS26119 requirement against what exists on `main`; section 6 of
`demo/run_sih_demo.sh` prints this list at the end of every run.

| not implemented | note |
|---|---|
| **GPU acceleration** | The first-order method it needs exists and runs on CPU - restarted PDHG, `--option algorithm=pdhg`, **9 of 9** committed instances to `optimal` at 1e-8 on `main` at `4177ae6` (`bench/results/pdhg-4177ae6.csv`, `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` section 1e). The ninth is `share2b`, which the first-order method alone leaves at its million-iteration limit: since #229 its answer is finished by the interior point by default (`pdhg_polish`), nine more iterations there, and section 1f.1 measures the same thing size by size - 6.1e-04 to 1.9e-10 at 1,000 rows, declined where the factor is not affordable. The CUDA port is on `main` (`src/gpu/`, #329 to #373), compiles in CI, and was measured by #390 on an NVIDIA RTX 5050 Laptop GPU, PDHG alone on the solver's own clock at 1e-4 and 1e-8 on synthetic KKT LPs (`bench/results/gpu-a4f02b1.csv`, `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` section 1g): slower than the CPU up to 5,000 x 5,000, where the launch and transfer cost is not amortised, and **1.63x** faster at 10,000 x 10,000 at 1e-4 (1.51x at 1e-8). `--gpu` on a build without CUDA warns and runs on the CPU; on a CUDA build it falls back to the CPU when the device, its compute capability or its memory fails the checks. That crossover on one card is the whole speed-up claimed. |
| **Scale** | Measured to 1,000,000 rows on generated instances only - no industrial model at that size - and the answer depends on the engine (#198, `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` sections 1f and 1f.1). On generated instances whose optimum is exact by construction: under a 120 s clock the first-order engine reaches the optimum at **100,000 x 100,000** to 1.1e-07 without certifying it and certifies it at 5,000 in 54 s, the interior point reaches it at 5,000 since the AMD ordering (#193) and the dual simplex only at 1,000 (`bench/results/scale-e134aeb.csv`, 7 of 12, measured on `main` after #242, #265 and #278). Given a fixed 1,000 iterations instead of a clock - the one accuracy claim here another machine reproduces exactly - the error stays between 6.9e-06 and 6.1e-04 all the way to **1,000,000 x 1,000,000**, so what grows with the model is the cost per iteration, not the number needed. Those are the random family's numbers, and a random sparse matrix is the worst case for anything that factorizes; on a second family shaped like a multi-period planning model (#198, section 1f.2, `bench/results/scale-staircase-e134aeb.csv`) the interior point reaches the optimum at **20,000** rows instead of 1,000 and 8 of 12 solves reach it against 7 of 12. The polish that finishes PDHG's answer (#229) is measured beside the unpolished run in section 1f.1 (`bench/results/scale-iterations-bf3df02.csv`): at 1,000 rows the same 1,000 iterations land at 6.1e-04 unpolished and 1.9e-10 polished, and at every larger size of the random family the polish declines within its 30 s budget because the factor is dense, which the table shows rather than hides. On real models: the largest Netlib instance solved is `fit2d`, 25x10500 with 129018 nonzeros, in 0.3 s, and on Mittelmann's eight smallest LPs, 6,330 to 376,500 rows, the result is 0 of 8 inside 300 s. On an industrial-structured model - a T-period refinery planning LP with crudes, tanks, yields, capacities, quality budgets and delivery commitments, optimum exact by construction (`bench/runners/generate_refinery_lp.py`, #211, section 1f.3, `bench/results/scale-refinery-e134aeb.csv`) - the monthly year (1,068 rows) is solved exactly by all three engines, the daily year (**32,485 rows**) exactly by the interior point (45 iterations, 68 s) and by PDHG finished by it (92 s), and the hourly year (**779,640 rows**) is reached by PDHG to 1.0e-06 inside 120 s and proved by nothing: 6 of 9 solves. That is the first industrial-shaped model at this size the evidence holds, and the number to read is the daily year. |
| **Interior point as a default** | An interior-point method exists (#56, `--option algorithm=ipm`, Mehrotra predictor-corrector over a from-scratch sparse LDL^T) and since #353 the default `algorithm=auto` chooses it by rule: below 20,000 rows and 100,000 nonzeros the dual simplex runs (80 of 89 on the Netlib full set at `adb37bb`, `bench/results/netlib-full-adb37bb.csv`; on its own the interior point verifies 73 of 89 at `078cb24`, `bench/results/netlib-full-078cb24-ipm.csv`, up from 51 before #380's starting point and 69 before #389's regularization recovery; the 72 at `d8d434c` lost fit2p at the time limit on a slower pass), above either the interior point with crossover (maros-r7 solves in 9 s where the dual simplex hit the limit), from 100,000 rows PDHG; the answer carries the rule and the reason (`engine_rule`, `engine_reason`). The interior point still produces no basis of its own, so it is not the node engine. It stops the moment its iterate is not a number and returns the best finite one (#205), and it finishes PDHG's answers from PDHG's own point (#229), declining within `polish_max_seconds` when the factor is not affordable. On the random 20,000-row shape the interior point declines at a fifth of the time limit (#357) and PDHG takes the rest to a relative error of 8.8e-10; the three generated families under `auto` are `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` section 1f.4 (`bench/results/auto-scale-*-64d2e9a.csv`: 10 of 11 solves reach the analytic optimum). |
| **Cutting planes by default** | Root Gomory mixed-integer, lifted knapsack cover and mixed-integer rounding cuts, and cut rounds below the root, exist (#159, #221; `--option enable_root_cuts=true`, `tree_cut_depth=4`) and are off by default. On the 30-instance MIPLIB set at 60 s on `main` at `078cb24` a root round alone proves the same 9 at 1.049x the node count and loses one published match at the limit (`neos-3611689-kaihu`), while root plus tree rounds prove **10** at 0.920x with that match kept (`bench/results/miplib-cuts-{off,on,tree}.csv`; `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` section 2, with the root gap closed per instance). Turning the tree leg on by default is the open decision on #221; cut selection and scoring, which is what a round costing nodes usually means, is #415. Row aggregation landed (#355) and clique and {0,1/2} cuts with a GF(2) separator followed (#379, #404); none of them separates anything on b-ball, opt1217, rlp1 or noswot, whose objective integrality (#398) moved the bound and whose plateau is now #418's. Branch and bound itself has reliability branching (#69) and warm-started dual node LPs (#65). This is why MIPLIB proves few optima. |
| **Non-convex QP** | Refused deliberately, with an LDL^T certificate. A local optimum reported as a global one is not something this solver will do. |
| **MIQP bound quality** | MIQP is implemented, but its node bound comes from a first-order method and is only accurate to the tolerance it converged to, so pruning is deliberately kept on the conservative side and costs nodes. With root cuts off by default too, expect incumbents more often than proofs. |
| **Parallelism** | Single-threaded by default. `--option threads=N` runs the column loops of an iteration under OpenMP, deterministically - results are bit-identical at 1 and 8 threads - and at Netlib scale it is measured to buy nothing, because an iteration is too short to amortize the fork (#57). It is a correctness-preserving switch, not a speed claim. |

On speed against HiGHS: on the medium tier the objectives agree on all 50 instances, and
the speed ratio is, for the first time, a number two runs an hour apart agree on. Three
runs of the same binary on `main` at `bf3df02` (`bench/results/compare-highs-medium-
bf3df02.csv`, `-second.csv`, `-third.csv`; 16:17, 16:41 and 17:21 on the same afternoon,
alone on the machine, on mains) put the median per-instance ratio at **2.01x, 2.04x and
2.12x** - SANKHYA slower - with total solve time 2.64x, 2.56x and 2.62x. The first and the
third are an hour apart and agree within 6%, which is the bar #212 set for quoting it;
the earlier committed pair, three days apart, had read 1.38x and 2.11x, and that spread is
why the number was not quoted before. Read it as *about twice HiGHS's time on these
instances, on this laptop*: 9 to 16 of the 50 timing envelopes still overlap outright,
the instances solve in single-digit milliseconds, and the ratio belongs to this machine
state as much as to the solver.
The reproducible comparison is iteration count, where the gap narrowed by a third when
devex pricing became the default (#66); HiGHS's devex still takes fewer.

## What still needs doing

The list above is what the solver does not do; this is the work that would change it, as it
stands on `main` at the time of writing, each item with the issue that carries its
evidence and its acceptance criteria. Three kinds: things to **create** that do not exist,
things to **improve** that exist and are measured short, and work to **finish** that is
started. Nothing here is a claim; every row points at where the claim would have to be
earned.

### Create

| what | issue | why it matters, and what it takes |
|---|---|---|
| **CUDA backend for PDHG** | [#16](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/16), [#17](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/17), [#19](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/19); PR [#390](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/pull/390) | The "GPU-accelerated" in the problem statement's title. The plumbing (#16) and the kernels (#17) are on `main` and compile in the CUDA CI job; the evidence (#19) is the CPU-vs-GPU crossover by model size and the honest 1e-8 list, which #390 measured on an RTX 5050 and committed (`bench/results/gpu-a4f02b1.csv`, `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` section 1g): PDHG alone on the solver's own clock, a warm-up solve absorbing CUDA's context creation, after a first attempt that had timed the interior-point polish and the process start-up along with the solve was sent back. The measurement protocol is in [`docs/GPU_PLAN.md`](docs/GPU_PLAN.md). |
| **Crossover** | [#219](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/219) | Landed: `algorithm=ipm` now ends at a vertex by default (`crossover=true`), the dual simplex warm-started from a basis guessed off the interior point, so the answer carries a basis for warm starts and sensitivity ranging and every nonbasic variable sits on a bound (`src/simplex/crossover.cpp`). The pivot count is in the message and in the Netlib CSV's iteration column (`bench/results/netlib-{small,medium}-77aa9e6-ipm.csv`). The primal push of #343 (`src/simplex/simplex_push.cpp`) is what makes it cheap on a degenerate model: the 5,000-row staircase reaches its verified optimum in 1,007 pivots where the push-less crossover took 41,872 and a cold dual simplex 34,071, and on the Netlib medium tier the median is 34 pivots. A guess the basis cannot reproduce feasibly (wood1p) declines the push and the interior point's answer stands. |
| **Warm start and in-place modification** | [#218](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/218) | Landed: `SolveControl` carries a starting basis, `sankhya_solve_from()` and `Model.solve(start=...)` restart from a previous solution after `set_col_bounds` / `set_row_bounds` / `set_cost` edits (bound and right-hand-side edits through the dual simplex, cost edits through the primal), presolve bypassed and said so; the solution and the verifier both carry the basis, and the verifier now checks it has exactly m basic entries with every nonbasic one on its bound. `demo/warm_start_prices.py` is the five-prices scene. What remains: a warm start through a presolved model, and warm starts for the interior point. |
| **Branch-and-cut proper** | [#221](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/221) | Mixed-integer rounding cuts, and cuts below the root. Root Gomory and cover cuts exist and are off by default because they cost a proof on MIPLIB; MIR cuts from original rows are the standard remedy for the loose root bounds that keep the MIPLIB proof count where it is. |
| **Parallel tree search** | [#222](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/222) | Landed in #403: `--option mip_threads=N` runs the tree on N workers, each on its own subtree with its own node LPs, sharing the incumbent, the node count, the pool and the pseudocosts; the objective and status do not depend on N, the tree explored does. The default stays 1: on the 30 MIPLIB instances at 60 s, as observed on the branch, four threads reach the same 14 and prove the same 9, explore 2x to 4x the nodes, and are slower on the small proofs (geometric mean 0.70x on the nine that finish). The A/B on `main` with the runner's `--threads` column is the follow-up. |
| **Convex NLP behind the `solve()` seam** | [#226](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/226) | The one PS26119 line still marked partial for a reason: the seam dispatches four classes cleanly and no nonlinear engine sits behind it. Convex, separable objective by callbacks; not general nonconvex, not MINLP. |
| **Certificates and gap targets in the C API and Python** | [#207](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/207) | The Farkas vector, the ray, the IIS and the gap tolerances are all in the `.sol` file and checked by the verifier, and none is reachable from C or Python. Accessors only. |

### Improve

| what | issue | where it stands |
|---|---|---|
| **The dual simplex's cost per iteration at size** | [#210](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/210), [#243](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/243) | #242 removed two O(m)-per-step sweeps from the factorization and the per-iteration recomputation of the basic values and duals; the per-phase clock it added (verbose log) now puts the pivot row - a BTRAN of a unit vector plus a gather over every column - at a quarter to a third of an iteration at 20,000 rows. Both standard remedies are in: the gather runs over rho's support through a row-wise copy of A (#265) and the transposed solve applies L^T in push form (#278), and the second measured to no change, because counters put a transposed solve's cost in the eta file (20,000 to 27,000 entries read per solve against a few hundred pushes through the factors) and in the four full-length passes over m; the Forrest-Tomlin update exists (`--option basis_update=forrest-tomlin`, [#279](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/279): the column is folded into U with a sparse spike and one row eta, and #396 added Tomlin's stability tests after the fold was measured drifting 2.5e-3 where the product form stayed at 1.1e-6 on a six-seed harness; with them 4.3e-8) but stays opt-in: it wins iterations on greenbea and d2q06c and loses them on perold and pilotnov, and the product form is the measured default. Two levers on the same cost remain untouched: the iteration COUNT, where dual steepest edge is what Devex left open ([#411](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/411)), and the work never done at all, where the presolve suite is eight reductions against the twenty the literature ranks ([#412](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/412), whose binary probing is also what would fill the conflict graph #379 found empty). None of the four 5,000- and 20,000-row scale models reaches the optimum in 120 s yet, but the iteration count inside those 120 s is up on every one: on `main` at `e134aeb` (`bench/results/scale-e134aeb.csv`, `scale-staircase-e134aeb.csv`) the dual simplex does 33,019 / 42,448 iterations at 5,000 rows (random / staircase) and 34,163 / 40,108 at 20,000, against 24,316 / 13,761 and 28,564 / 10,144 on the last runs before this work (`scale-f545f83.csv`, `scale-staircase-bf3df02.csv`). |
| **The unscaled retry on badly scaled generated models** | [#244](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/244) | When the scaled dual simplex times out, the unscaled retry repairs singular bases and hands over to the primal on a fresh-factor pivot disagreement. The dual ratio test accepts any pivot above an absolute 1e-9; a relative floor with a Harris pass is what production codes do. |
| **Netlib 80 of 89** | [#214](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/214) | The full-set re-run on `main` at `e134aeb` is done, and `b3f1660` after #244 repeats it instance for instance (`bench/results/netlib-full-b3f1660.csv`): `pilot87` and `dfl001` now finish inside 120 s and `pilot` verifies as optimal, so eight of the nine non-passes are Netlib's own table being the outlier with HiGHS agreeing with us. The one left that is ours to fix is `maros-r7`, which runs the clock out inside a factorization on the scaled attempt and does not finish on the unscaled retry (#247 for the history of that basis). |
| **Mittelmann 0 of 8 (simplex), 2 of 8 (PDHG)** | [#216](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/216) | The default dual simplex finishes nothing, re-measured on `main` at `e134aeb` with the same result (`bench/results/mittelmann-e134aeb.csv`; every row a named time limit, `bdry2` now stopped at 303 s). The per-engine table in section 1d (`mittelmann-{pdhg,ipm}-d24662f.csv`) shows the first-order engine finishing `chromaticindex1024-7` and `brazil3`, verified, and the interior point finishing none: two `std::bad_alloc` (#246), two non-finite iterates, four time limits, `Linf_520c` overrunning to 367 s inside a factorization. `qap15` stays a time limit under all three; the rest are size. Both files are far behind `main` - before the interior point went from 51 to 73 of 89 and before the out-of-memory guard (#326) that turns those two `std::bad_alloc` rows into a status - so the first step is a re-run, and the second is attributing each of the eight failures to one cause rather than counting them ([#417](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/417)). |
| **MIPLIB: 14 of 30 reach the optimum, 9 prove it** | [#215](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/215) | The weakest number in the project, and the issue says where each of the other instances stands. With root plus tree cut rounds (`enable_root_cuts=true tree_cut_depth=4`) the same run at `078cb24` reaches 14 and proves 10 (`bench/results/miplib-cuts-tree.csv`, `neos-3611689-kaihu` proved, nodes 0.920x): the first A/B where cuts gain a proof without losing a match, and whether that becomes the default is the open question on #221. What the 16 that never reach the optimum need is the incumbent, not the bound: `markshare1` reports 40 against 1 and `timtab1` is 59% high, and the heuristics that exist measurably hurt ([#414](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/414)). The rest of the work list, each with its own acceptance A/B: symmetry and orbital fixing for the instances that enumerate permutations ([#413](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/413)), cut selection and scoring ([#415](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/415)), root restarts and branching that can break a bound plateau ([#418](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/418)), and flow cover cuts for the fixed-charge family ([#419](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/419)). |
| **Interior point on the largest random model** | [#246](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/246) | On the 100,000-row random scale model it dies of `std::bad_alloc` 170 s past its 120 s limit with no status and no stats file, on an 8 GB machine: an out-of-memory condition must come back as a status, and the ordering needs a memory budget the way the polish has a factor budget. |
| **Interior point: stop before the barrier breaks the factorization** | [#209](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/209), [#392](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/392) | Closed. #241 reads the regularization spike as convergence; #389 raises the regularization and recomputes the step when a Newton direction comes back non-finite (Netlib under `ipm` 69 to 72 of 89, `bench/results/netlib-full-d8d434c-ipm.csv`); #397 takes one more step on the stronger diagonal at the stop, which brings the worst complementarity product under the verifier's tolerance: the 20,000-row staircase goes from `feasible` to `optimal` and crossover then finishes it in 11 s where it ran past 300 s. |

### Finish

| what | where it stands |
|---|---|
| **The final read** ([#213](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/213)) | A person reading the submission cold with the problem statement open, before 20 September. Not a code task. Two automated audits found and fixed stale and contradictory claims; a third pair of eyes is the point. |
| **The demo recording** ([#73](https://github.com/thegoodengineers/SANKHYA/issues/73)) | The one open box of the packaging issue, for the PS metadata's YouTube field. `demo/run_sih_demo.sh --quick` is what to record. |
