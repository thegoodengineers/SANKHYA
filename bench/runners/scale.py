"""How far up does this solver actually go? (#198)

PS26119 asks for "thousands to millions of variables", and until this script there was no
CSV behind any answer to that - only one 5000x5000 instance solved live in the demo, which
is a demonstration, not a benchmark. `docs/PS26119_COVERAGE.md` has called this the project's
biggest single gap for weeks, and the reason it stayed a gap is that a large RANDOM instance
proves nothing: nobody knows its optimum, so a wrong answer and a right one look identical.

bench/runners/generate_large_lp.py solves that by building the instance BACKWARDS from a
chosen primal-dual pair that already satisfies the KKT conditions, out of integer data. The
optimal objective is therefore known exactly before the solver sees the file, at any size.
This runner walks a family of sizes, hands each instance to each engine under one time
limit, and records what came back next to what was true by construction.

WHAT THE NUMBERS HERE MEAN, AND WHAT THEY DO NOT. The accuracy columns are properties of the
solver: an objective is right or it is not, whatever machine measured it. The seconds are a
property of this laptop on the day, and the STATUS column depends on both - an engine that
runs out of time at one size on a slow machine may finish there on a fast one. Read the
error column first and the clock second.

Usage:
    python bench/runners/scale.py --binary build/sankhya
    python bench/runners/scale.py --sizes 1000 5000 20000 --engines pdhg --time-limit 300
