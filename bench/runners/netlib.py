"""Run SANKHYA over the fetched Netlib instances and emit the evidence CSV.

Every column ENGINEERING_RULES.md requires is here: instance, sha256 of the instance file, our
objective, the PUBLISHED reference objective, absolute and relative gap, status, wall time,
iterations, git commit and a machine tag. Without the CSV there is no claim.

Two things this runner does that a plain timing loop would not:

*   The reference values come from ``data/netlib/reference.json``, which ``fetch_data.py``
    parsed out of Netlib's own readme. No number here was typed from memory.

*   Every solution is handed to ``tools/verify_solution.py``, which re-parses the model with
    its own MPS reader and re-derives feasibility, the objective and strong duality without
    touching our C++. Matching the published optimum says the answer is right; the verifier
    says the answer is *self-consistent*, and the two failures look nothing alike.

Usage:
    python bench/runners/netlib.py
    python bench/runners/netlib.py --binary build/sankhya --time-limit 60
    python bench/runners/netlib.py --check        # fail if the pass rate dropped

    # anywhere else: the medium tier is 43/50 and the full set 71/89, so pointing CI at
    # either would paint the job permanently red, and a job that is always red is a job
    # everyone learns to ignore - the exact outcome the cache comment above worries about.

    # A VERIFIER REJECTION IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF EVENT FROM A MISSED OPTIMUM. Failing to
    # reach the published value can be a known limitation: too slow, not accurate enough,
    # honestly recorded in docs/BENCHMARKS.md and named in #34. But the verifier re-derives
    # the answer from the original file and shares no code with the solver, so its rejection
    # says the solution is internally inconsistent - infeasible, or its duals do not price
    # its primal. That is never acceptable and never a known limitation.
    #
    # This distinction is not hypothetical. #149 (presolve free-column-singleton and
    # doubleton-equation) passed all five CI checks and regressed the DUAL on seven of the
    # first thirty Netlib instances: the objective matched the published optimum to ten
    # significant figures while the reduced costs were out by 6.9e-01. Nothing except the
    # verifier could see it, and the job that runs the verifier was pointed at nine
    # instances none of which trigger those reductions.

        # check in solve.cpp caught the duals violating tolerance and overrode it. That is
        # not declining a claim; it is making one and being caught. And it was invisible
        # here: the status is no longer "optimal", so the verifier skipped the duals, so
        # nothing was rejected, and recipe dropped from a pass to a silent non-pass on the
        # #149 merge with the gate green. The stricter our own check, the less this gate
