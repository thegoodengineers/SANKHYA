"""Generate docs/BENCHMARKS.md from the CSVs in bench/results/.

docs/BENCHMARKS.md is NOT hand-written. It is regenerated from the evidence files so it
cannot drift from them: if a number appears in the document, a CSV row produced it, and the
CSV records the instance sha256, the git commit and the machine that produced it.

Reporting follows Mittelmann's conventions (plato.asu.edu):

*   the SHIFTED GEOMETRIC MEAN of solve times, shift 1 second. An arithmetic mean is
    dominated by the slowest instance and a plain geometric mean is dominated by the
    fastest; the shift damps both ends, which is why the benchmark community uses it.
*   the time limit is stated explicitly, because a mean over a censored sample is
    meaningless without it.
*   failures are COUNTED AND NAMED. An instance we cannot solve stays in the table.

    stopped without exhausting the tree. Reporting one number for both would either discard a
    correct answer or launder a limit stop into a proof.

    that meets the requested gap target now reports `optimal`, the way every MIP solver
    means the word, so a rerun counts those rows as proved; every CSV committed before #188

<!-- GENERATED FILE. Do not edit by hand. -->

This file is generated from the CSVs in `bench/results/`, so it cannot drift from the
evidence. Every number below came out of a run that recorded the instance sha256, the git
commit and the machine tag alongside it. CI checks that every CSV's commit is on `main`
(`bench/runners/check_result_stamps.py`, #433); a run made on a branch and carried to `main`
by a squash merge keeps the commit it was produced on and is listed with that squash merge
in `bench/results/squash-stamps.txt`, so the number still ties back to a build.

Times in sections 1a-1c, 1f and 2 are wall-clock, measured around the whole process, so they
include reading the model and writing the outputs. That makes them slightly pessimistic and
honest; it is not the figure to quote for algorithmic speed, and no attempt is made to
dress it up. Section 1d prints solver-internal seconds (its instances take minutes, and the
read is not what is being measured) and section 4 is solver-internal on both sides, as it
says.

Reporting follows Mittelmann's conventions: shifted geometric means with a
{SHIFT_SECONDS:g}-second shift, an explicit time limit, and failures counted and named
rather than dropped.

## 1. Netlib LP — accuracy against published optima

The reference optimum for each instance is parsed by `bench/runners/fetch_data.py` from
Netlib's own `readme`. None of these values was typed from memory.

### 1a. The small set — what the demo runs

Nine instances, committed to the repository so a fresh clone can reproduce this with no
network. **This is the set `demo/run_demo.sh` lets a judge pick from, and it is the easy end
of Netlib.** Its pass rate is not the headline; section 1c is.

{netlib_section(netlib_csv)}
### 1b. The medium tier — instances up to 500 rows

{medium_section(medium_csv)}
### 1c. The full set — the honest headline

Every instance in Netlib's summary table. Both tiers above are defined by a row cap, which
makes them the easier half of the library by construction; this is the number Phase 6's
">= 95% of Netlib" exit criterion is measured against, and the one the README quotes.

{full_section(full_csv)}
**`pilot87` passes this table and is 1.1e-6 from the exact optimum (#548).** The table
grades against Netlib's own readme value, 301.71072827; Koch's exact rational
recomputation (ZIB-Report 03-05, 2003) gives 301.710347333, and ours, 301.71069146, is
1.2e-7 from the readme and 1.1e-6 from the exact value. Reproduced on `main` at
`d709281` (`sankhya solve data/netlib/pilot87.mps`, default options, `simplex-dual+primal`)
and re-checked by `tools/verify_solution.py`, which shares no code with the solver: primal
infeasibility 3.8e-12, complementarity 6.8e-15, and one column, `CPCSU04`, with a
reduced-cost violation of 6.786e-08 - under the 1e-7 dual feasibility tolerance, so the
status is `optimal` by policy - which the verifier's gap accounting names as the source of
essentially the whole 3.2e-4 absolute duality gap. So the attribution is a dual that is
not quite feasible on a badly scaled model, not an infeasible primal basis and not a
relaxed unscaled retry (none ran). Not fixed here: tightening the dual tolerance to chase
one instance is the move the evidence rules forbid without a numerical justification,
and #548 stays open for a scale-aware reduced-cost test.

### 1c.1 The Kennington set - the next rung

The sixteen Kennington LPs (the `cre`, `ken`, `osa` and `pds` families, Carolan et al.,
Operations Research 38(2), 1990), larger and sparser than the core Netlib set. Fetched and
hashed by `bench/runners/fetch_kennington.py`, which parses the published optima from the
directory's own readme; run by `bench/runners/kennington.py` under the full-set rules.

### 1d. Beyond Netlib — Mittelmann's LP set

Netlib's largest instance has about 6,000 rows. PS26119 asks about "thousands to millions
of variables", and the only honest way to say where this solver stands on that is to run
instances of that size and name what happens. These are the eight smallest archives in
Mittelmann's LP test set (`bench/runners/fetch_mittelmann.py`, provenance in
`data/mittelmann/reference.json`).

{mittelmann_section(mittelmann_csv)}
#### The same eight under each engine

{mittelmann_engines_section(mittelmann_csv, mittelmann_pdhg_csv, mittelmann_ipm_csv)}
### 1e. The first-order engine — PDHG

The simplex is not the only continuous engine. Restarted PDHG (`--option algorithm=pdhg`) is
a first-order method: no basis, no factorization, and a cost that depends enormously on the
accuracy asked of it - which is why this section reports two tolerances separately rather
than one blended number. It is also the engine the GPU work targets, so its CPU behaviour is
the baseline every GPU claim will be measured against.

{pdhg_section(pdhg_csv)}

**The relative KKT error, and the three crossing times (#486).** Every PDHG run records
`kkt_1e4_seconds`, `kkt_1e6_seconds` and `kkt_1e8_seconds` in the stats JSON and, where a
runner carries them, in its CSV: the solver clock at which the relative KKT error first
came at or under that level, measured at the engine's evaluation interval. The error is
the PDLP definition, `max(||Ax - proj(Ax)|| / (1 + ||b||), ||c - A'y - z|| / (1 + ||c||),
|c'x - b'y| / (1 + |c'x| + |b'y|))` in the 2-norm on the unscaled model
(`src/pdhg/pdhg_evaluate.hpp`), which is the measurement published PDLP and cuPDLP figures
use and the one Mittelmann's LP feasibility page is quoted at (1e-6, no basis). A crossing
is what a first-order method reaches at a relative tolerance; it is NOT an optimal basis and
NOT the project's absolute standard, which is what `optimal` in the status column means and
what the verifier checks. `nan` in a crossing column means the level was never reached in
that run.

### 1g. GPU PDHG crossover — when the GPU wins

The GPU backend (`algorithm=pdhg gpu=true`) offloads the matrix-vector products to CUDA.
Small problems spend more time on data transfer than on computation; the crossover point
below is where the GPU overtakes the CPU.

{gpu_section(gpu_csv)}
#### 1g.1 GPU on non-synthetic instances

{gpu_real_section(gpu_real_csv)}
#### 1g.2 GPU PDHG vs OR-Tools PDLP

{gpu_pdlp_section(gpu_pdlp_csv)}
#### 1g.3 The same measurements on a datacenter card

Everything above 1g.3 is one laptop card. A rented card (E2E Networks TIR) runs the same
runners from a fresh clone at a `main` commit; the CPU column in each table is that
machine's own CPU, so a ratio here is card against host, not card against the laptop.

{gpu_cards_section()}
#### 1g.4 What the CPU side does with its cores

Every CPU column above is one thread. `pdhg_parallel_spmv` (#487) computes A x row-parallel
over the `threads` workers, bitwise the same at any thread count (the test holds it to the
bit); this is what it buys, per instance, at a fixed iteration count:

### 1f. Scale — how far up this goes

Every tier above is Netlib-sized: the largest instance in the full set has 12,230 columns, and
most have a few hundred, so none of them speaks to the size PS26119 asks about.

{scale_section(scale_csv)}
#### 1f.1 The same question without the clock

{per_iteration_section(per_iteration_csv)}
#### 1f.2 The same sizes on a second shape

{structured_scale_section(scale_csv, staircase_csv)}
#### 1f.3 A refinery planning model, by the year

{refinery_scale_section(refinery_csv)}
#### 1f.4 The same families under `algorithm=auto`

{auto_scale_section(auto_scale_csvs)}

## 2. MIPLIB — the mixed-integer side

The LP tiers above say nothing about the branch and bound. This is the MILP evidence, and it
is a harder library: MIPLIB instances are chosen to be difficult for mature solvers.

## 2b. Maros-Meszaros, the convex QP set

The 138 convex QPs of Maros and Meszaros, *A repository of convex quadratic programming
problems*, Optimization Methods and Software 11-12 (1999): the set every convex QP paper
reports. Solved by the default QP engine (Condat-Vu, `src/qp/`) and judged the way the
published QP benchmark judges it, on primal residual, dual residual and duality gap at 1e-6
and at 1e-9, as well as against the published objective and by the independent verifier.

## 3. Correctness beyond the objective value

An objective that matches a published number is necessary, not sufficient — it says nothing
about whether the reported solution is internally consistent. Two independent checks cover
that, and both run in CI:

- **`tools/verify_solution.py`** re-parses the model with its own MPS reader, recomputes the
  row activities, the objective, the reduced costs and the dual objective, and checks primal
  feasibility, dual feasibility, complementary slackness and strong duality. It shares no
  code with the solver, so a reader bug shows up as a disagreement rather than as agreement.
  The `verified` column above is its verdict.

- **The exact rational oracle** (`tests/oracles/`) solves generated instances in exact
  arithmetic with no rounding error anywhere, and the floating-point simplex is compared
  against it. See `docs/PROVENANCE.md` for the citations.

### 3a. Netlib's infeasible set - a verdict is only as good as its certificate

Chinneck's collection of infeasible LPs (`netlib.org/lp/infeas`, fetched and hashed by
`bench/runners/fetch_netlib_infeasible.py`). Every instance is infeasible, so the status
alone proves nothing; a pass needs the Farkas certificate the solver wrote to survive
`tools/verify_solution.py` (`bench/runners/netlib_infeasible.py`).

{infeasible_section(infeasible_csv, infeasible_engine_csvs)}
### 3b. Parametric LP - the optimal value as a function of one coefficient

`tools/parametric.py` walks one cost or one right-hand side across a range: from the optimal
basis at the start it reads the ranging interval (#220) to find where that basis stops being
optimal, jumps there, warm-starts (#218) from the basis it is leaving, and records the
objective and the basis change at every breakpoint. Each reported point is a fresh optimum
re-solved and checked by `tools/test_parametric.py` through the verifier's own MPS reader,
not a value extrapolated from ranging. It re-solves at each breakpoint rather than pivoting
once as a dedicated parametric simplex would; the tool's docstring says what that costs.

## 4. Comparison against an established solver

HiGHS is the reference. It runs as a SEPARATE PROCESS over the same MPS files; no HiGHS code
is linked into, or read by, SANKHYA - see `docs/PROVENANCE.md`. Both sides are timed on
solver-internal time only.

The comparison below is run on **the same tier as section 1b**, not on the nine-instance
demo set. Comparing only where we pass would be the easy version of this table and would say
nothing: the instances we fail are exactly the ones a reader should want to see against a
mature solver.

{comparison_section(compare_csv)}
---

## 5. Robustness — where the solver stops working

PS26119 asks for "a clear demonstration of numerical robustness ... involving degeneracy,
weak LP relaxations or ill-conditioned constraint matrices". `data/casestudies/` demonstrates
each hazard on one chosen instance; this section is the sweep that finds the case we do not
handle. Every instance is built from a chosen primal-dual pair, so its optimum is known
before it is solved (the construction is `tests/oracles/lp_generator.hpp`'s, in
`bench/runners/robustness.py`), and each family pushes one hazard until the answer, or the
certificate, moves. The reduced version runs in CI (`tests/robustness/`), together with the
adversarial families judged by the exact rational oracle and the classic cycling examples
of Beale and Kuhn.

{robustness_section(robustness_csv)}

## 6. What these numbers do not say

- **The large-model evidence is sections 1d and 1f to 1f.3, and none of it is a real
  million-variable industrial model.** 1d is Mittelmann's set, a table of named time limits.
  1f to 1f.3 are generated instances whose optimum is exact by construction: under a clock
  the first-order engine reaches 100,000 rows and columns, the interior point 5,000 on the
  random shape and 20,000 on the staircase, and the dual simplex 1,000; under a fixed
  iteration budget the random shape goes to 1,000,000; the largest refinery-shaped model
  solved exactly is 32,485 rows. No pass rate in the Netlib sections above substitutes for
  any of it. Tracked as #198 and as part of #54.
- Wall-clock times at this size are dominated by process start-up and file reading, so
  ratios between solvers are not meaningful until the instances get big enough to matter.
  The comparison in section 4 uses solver-internal time on both sides for that reason.
- The failures in section 1b are real and are not going to be quietly dropped from a later
  edition of this file. Each one carries the issue tracking it.
- The GPU PDHG backend is measured in section 1g. The interior-point method (`algorithm=ipm`, #56) is opt-in and produces no
  basis, so it is not the engine behind any Netlib or MIPLIB table above - sections 1f to
  1f.3 are the exception, where it appears beside the others: since the AMD ordering (#193)
  it reaches 5,000 rows on the random shape and 20,000 on the staircase, and solves the
  32,485-row refinery year exactly (#206, #211). Its own Netlib run is committed as `netlib-full-*-ipm.csv` and quoted in
  `docs/PS26119_COVERAGE.md`, not here, because a run made with a non-default option is a
  measurement of that option rather than the tier's evidence. `docs/PROVENANCE.md` and issue #54 carry the full accounting.
