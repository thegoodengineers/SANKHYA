"""Fetch Mittelmann's LP benchmark instances (#60), with recorded provenance.

PS26119 names "MIPLIB, Netlib or Mittelmann benchmark sets". Netlib and MIPLIB have runners;
this is the third. The instances come from Hans Mittelmann's LP test set,

    https://plato.asu.edu/ftp/lptestset/          (the archive this script reads)
    https://plato.asu.edu/ftp/lpfeas.html          (the benchmark page and its time limits)

as bzip2-compressed MPS files. They are LARGE - the benchmark page runs them with a 15,000 s
limit and its smallest members are still an order of magnitude beyond Netlib's largest - so
this script fetches a NAMED SUBSET, `small`, of the smallest archives by size, which is the
honest place to start: a runner that reports failures by name is worth more than one that
never ran. `--set full` fetches every top-level archive in the directory.

Provenance recorded per instance in data/mittelmann/reference.json: the archive URL, the
sha256 of the archive and of the decompressed MPS, and both sizes. No published optimum is
recorded, because the benchmark page publishes solver TIMES, not objective values; the
runner therefore reports the verifier's verdict and cross-checks against HiGHS when it is
available, rather than a pass against a number nobody printed.

    python bench/runners/fetch_mittelmann.py              # the small set
    python bench/runners/fetch_mittelmann.py --set full   # everything at the top level
