"""Fetch the Netlib LP test set and its PUBLISHED optimal objective values.

Two things this script is careful about, both for the same reason: a benchmark table is
only evidence if a judge can regenerate it.

1.  The reference optima are PARSED from Netlib's own ``readme`` (the PROBLEM SUMMARY
    TABLE), never typed in from memory. If the published value and our value disagree, the
    disagreement has to be about our solver, not about somebody's recollection.

2.  Netlib distributes these instances in a custom compressed encoding, not as MPS. The
    canonical decoder is ``emps.c``, published by Netlib alongside the data. We download and
    compile it at fetch time rather than vendoring it, so this repository contains no
    third-party source; the sha256 of everything downloaded is recorded in the manifest.

``emps.c`` is a file-format converter, not a solver, so it is outside the ENGINEERING_RULES.md red
line. Nothing it produces is linked into SANKHYA; it runs once, offline, to turn Netlib's
archive format into plain MPS.

Usage:
    python bench/runners/fetch_data.py                # the default small set
    python bench/runners/fetch_data.py afiro sc50a    # named instances

# with instances big enough for the basis factorization to matter, and `full` is the number
# Phase 6's ">= 95% of Netlib" exit criterion is actually measured against.

# does not silently drift as instances are added, and so nobody has to curate it.

    #     sankhya solve data/netlib/israel.mps --option scaling=false
