"""Compare SANKHYA against HiGHS on identical instances, same machine, same time limit.

HiGHS is invoked ONLY as an external subprocess binary. It is never linked into SANKHYA,
never a build dependency, and no part of its source informs ours - see the red line in
ENGINEERING_RULES.md and section 1 of docs/PROVENANCE.md. This script shells out to whatever `highs`
executable the machine already has, reads its stdout, and compares numbers. That is the
entire relationship.

The comparison exists because the problem statement asks us to compare against an
established solver, not to beat one. Expect to lose on time: HiGHS is a decade of
specialist work. Losing by a stated factor on instances where both agree on the objective
is a far stronger result than a benchmark that quietly omits the comparison.

Installing HiGHS (any of these; none of them touches the build):
    apt-get install highs                 # Debian/Ubuntu
    conda install -c conda-forge highs
    or download a release from https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases

Usage:
    python bench/runners/compare.py
    python bench/runners/compare.py --highs-binary /path/to/highs --time-limit 60

THE HEAD-TO-HEAD MODE (#766). With --suite, every solver - SANKHYA, HiGHS, SCIP, CBC/Clp and
GLPK - runs over a whole test set, each as a separate process with one thread and the
suite's time limit (120 s for Netlib and Kennington, 60 s for Maros-Meszaros), and every
answer is checked by tools/verify_solution.py. The rivals live in rivals.py and the loop in
compare_suite.py; both docstrings say exactly how a run is graded.

    python bench/runners/compare.py --suite netlib

    At that scale a single timing measures the operating system's scheduling luck at least
    as much as it measures either solver, and the reported figure moved run to run without
    a line of code changing: across five consecutive runs of an unchanged binary the median
    ratio came out 0.89x, 0.93x, 0.97x, 0.92x and 0.71x, and one instance swung by a factor
    of three. A benchmark number that changes when nothing changed is not evidence, and this
    project's whole claim is that its numbers are reproducible.

    The median, not the mean: timing noise on a loaded desktop is one-sided - a run can be
    delayed arbitrarily but cannot finish faster than the work takes - so the distribution
    has a long right tail that drags a mean around. The median ignores it.

    The first `warmup` runs are discarded. The first solve of an instance pays for reading
    the file into the OS page cache, and for our process, for loading the binary itself.
    That cost is real but it is not solve time, and charging it to whichever solver happens
    to run first is exactly the kind of accident this function exists to remove.
