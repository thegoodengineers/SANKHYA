// SANKHYA - the floating-point simplex against the exact oracle.
//
// THIS IS THE GATE. Every other test in the suite checks that the solver does what its
// author expected. This one checks that it does what the mathematics requires, on instances
// nobody chose, against an answer computed without a single rounding error.
//
// A mismatch here is the most important output the project can produce, so when one occurs
// the failure prints the whole instance, both objectives and the difference. A pass rate
// with no reproducible failing case is a claim, not evidence.
//
// The two engines see ONE instance, not two: GeneratedLp is handed to solve_exact() and to
// to_model() -> solve(), so a disagreement cannot be blamed on the file format.
