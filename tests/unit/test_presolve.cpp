// SANKHYA - presolve and postsolve tests.
//
// THE GATE HERE IS THE ROUND TRIP, not the reduction counts. A presolve that removes nothing
// is merely useless; a presolve whose postsolve is wrong returns a confident, feasible-
// looking answer to a DIFFERENT problem, with no crash and no stack trace. ENGINEERING_RULES.md
// names that class of failure as the worst available outcome, alongside reporting a MILP's
// fractional relaxation as optimal.
//
// So every test below solves the SAME model twice, with presolve on and off, and requires
// the two to agree on the objective AND on dual feasibility. The second half matters as much
// as the first: three separate postsolve bugs found while writing this produced the right
// objective and wrong duals, and every one of them was caught by the status guard
// downgrading `optimal` to `feasible` rather than by a wrong number.

// Fuzz: free-column-singleton and doubleton-equation, deliberately at scale
//

// generic fuzz gate in tests/oracles/ rarely happens to produce an EXACT equality row with
// EXACTLY two nonzero entries, or a genuinely free column appearing in exactly one row -
// these two reductions need that specific structure to fire at all. Three real postsolve
// bugs were found writing this file BY HAND (a cost fold that ignored an earlier fold's
// cascade, a fill-in coefficient reduced_cost_of did not know about, and a doubleton's
// eliminated column independently forcing the row's dual even though its partner did not
// need the help) - all three were interaction bugs between reductions, exactly the kind
// generic random generation is least likely to construct on its own. So this generator
// builds the structure deliberately, at scale, rather than hoping for it.
