// SANKHYA - restarted PDHG tests.
//
// The controlling test in this file is AgreesWithTheSimplexOnGeneratedInstances. Two engines
// with nothing in common beyond the Model - one pivoting on exact ratios, one taking
// projected gradient steps - landing on the same objective is much stronger evidence than
// either matching a hand-written expectation. It is also the only cheap way to test PDHG at
// all: a first-order method has no basis to inspect and no pivot sequence to reason about.
//
// Note what is NOT asserted here: that PDHG is fast. On instances this small it is
// enormously slower than the simplex, by design and by construction. Its value is at a scale
// where a dense factorization cannot go, and on hardware this suite does not run on.
