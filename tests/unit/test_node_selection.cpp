// SANKHYA - node selection policies (#293).
//
// The correctness gate for these lives in test_branch_and_bound.cpp, where every policy is
// run against the exact rational oracle: order may change, answers may not. What is left for
// this file is the part the oracle cannot see - that the policies actually DIFFER, that ties
// are broken the same way twice, and that the search reports which one it used.
//
// A policy framework whose policies all behave identically would pass every correctness test
// ever written and be worth nothing, so the tests below fail if the tree does not change
// shape between them.

/// for the policies to disagree about, little enough for a unit test.
