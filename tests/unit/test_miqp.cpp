// MIQP is branch and bound over QP node relaxations. The failure this file exists to catch is
// the one solve() previously avoided by refusing the class outright: reporting a RELAXATION as
// though it were the integer answer. That point is feasible, its objective is a real number,
// and nothing about it looks wrong - so every test below pins the integer optimum against a
// hand-derived value AND checks the relaxation is a different number, so a solver that quietly
// dropped integrality would fail rather than coincide.
