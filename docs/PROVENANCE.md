# SANKHYA — provenance

This document exists so that the claim "built from mathematical foundations, not wrapped
around an existing solver" can be **checked** rather than believed. It is maintained
continuously, not written at the end.

Last updated: **Phase 6** (sparse LU), with the HiGHS comparison run. Every number and every command output below was
produced by running the command shown, on the machine described, at the commit recorded.

---

## 1. The red line

No source code from an optimization **solver** is copied, vendored, linked, or read. That
list explicitly includes CBC, Clp, HiGHS, SCIP, SoPlex, GLPK, lp_solve, OSQP, PDLP,
cuPDLP / cuPDLP-C / cuPDLPx, OR-Tools GLOP and CP-SAT, Gurobi, CPLEX and Xpress — not their
simplex, not their cuts, not their MPS readers.

HiGHS appears in this project **only** as the comparison baseline in
`bench/runners/compare.py`. It runs either as an externally installed command-line binary or,
where none is present, through the `highspy` pip package in a separate Python process. It is
never linked into SANKHYA, never a build dependency, and no part of its source informs ours.
The comparison results are in `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` section 3.

## 2. Dependency table

Every dependency is a general-purpose library. None of them solves an optimization problem.

| Dependency | Version | Licence | Linked? | Why it is not a solver |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **fmt** | 10.2.1 | MIT | yes, static | String formatting. Produces text from values. |
| **CLI11** | 2.4.2 | BSD-3-Clause | header-only | Command-line argument parsing. |
| **nlohmann/json** | 3.11.3 | MIT | header-only | JSON serialisation for the `--stats` result blob. |
| **OpenMP runtime** (libgomp with GCC, libomp with Clang) | as shipped by the compiler | GPL-3.0 with the GCC Runtime Library Exception / Apache-2.0 with LLVM exception | optional, found by CMake | The compiler's own thread runtime for `#pragma omp parallel for`. Schedules loops; contains no numerical code of any kind. |
| **zlib** | 1.3.1 | zlib | yes, static | DEFLATE decompression, for `.mps.gz` inputs (Phase 2). |
| **GoogleTest** | 1.14.0 | BSD-3-Clause | test binary only | Unit test framework. Never linked into `sankhya_core`. |
| **CUDA runtime (cudart)** | as shipped with CUDA Toolkit | NVIDIA SDK Licence | yes, when `SANKHYA_ENABLE_CUDA=ON` | Device enumeration and the probe in `src/gpu/device.cu`. No kernel launch, no transfer. |
| **cuSPARSE** | as shipped with CUDA Toolkit | NVIDIA SDK Licence | yes, when `SANKHYA_ENABLE_CUDA=ON` | Sparse matrix-vector products on GPU (`cusparseSpMV`). Supplies the A x and A^T y arithmetic primitives called by the GPU PDHG iteration in `src/gpu/pdhg_gpu.cu` (#17), in the same way that a BLAS supplies `dgemv` to a simplex without being a simplex. Not an optimisation algorithm. |
| **cuBLAS** | as shipped with CUDA Toolkit | NVIDIA SDK Licence | **not linked** | Dense linear algebra on GPU. Not needed by the current GPU backend; listed here so the absence is a decision, not an oversight. |
| **CUB (CCCL)** | as shipped with CUDA Toolkit | BSD-3-Clause | header-only, when `SANKHYA_ENABLE_CUDA=ON` | Device-wide parallel reductions (`DeviceReduce::Sum`) used by the GPU PDHG movement and interaction scalars in `src/gpu/pdhg_gpu.cu` (#17). Ships inside the CUDA Toolkit as part of NVIDIA CCCL; no separate fetch or link step. Not an optimisation algorithm. |
| **highspy** | pip, benchmark only | MIT | **never linked** | The HiGHS solver, used ONLY as the comparison baseline in `bench/runners/compare.py`. It runs in a separate Python process, is not a build dependency, and nothing in `src/` knows it exists. Its source does not inform ours - see the red line in section 1. |

Considered, and not present. Each was allowed by the policy above; none turned out to be
needed, and none is linked, vendored or fetched:

| Dependency | Licence | Status |
|---|---|---|
| pybind11 | BSD-3-Clause | Not used. The Python bindings (#59, #129) are `ctypes` over the C API and compile nothing. |
| AMD / COLAMD ordering | per-module | Not used as a library. The sparse LDL^T (#70) carries its own ordering, written from the AMD paper (Amestoy, Davis & Duff 1996) for #193 - approximate minimum degree on a quotient graph - with no code from SuiteSparse or anywhere else; the LU orders by Markowitz counts. |
| Eigen | MPL-2.0 | Not used. `DenseLu` (`src/simplex/dense_lu.cpp`) is the reference oracle the sparse LU is tested against. |

## 2b. Toolchains this has been built and tested with

PS26119 asks for a foundation someone else can pick up, and "it builds here" is not that.
These are the toolchains the evidence in `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` was actually produced with, and
the ones CI exercises on every push. `scripts/preflight.sh` reports what it finds on the
machine it runs on, and `scripts/configure.sh` chooses among them rather than trusting the
order of `PATH`.

| Where | Compiler | Build system | Python | What it is the authority on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CI, `ubuntu-latest` | the runner's default GCC | CMake >= 3.20, Ninja | 3.x as shipped | `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` cleanliness, the ASan/UBSan run, and the Netlib gates. A portability claim rests on the Linux build. |
| Development, Windows 11 | GCC 16.1.0, MSYS2 UCRT64 (`C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin\g++.exe`) | CMake 4.3.3, Ninja 1.13.2 | 3.11.9 | Every benchmark CSV in `bench/results/` whose `machine` column reads `Windows-AMD64`. |
| Development, Windows 11 (fallback) | GCC 13.2.0, Strawberry Perl MinGW-W64 | as shipped | 3.x | A second Windows compiler the configure script accepts; no committed CSV comes from it. |

**One toolchain must never be selected**: a MinGW 6.3.0 that predates C++20 and sits on
`PATH` on at least one development box. `scripts/configure.sh` rejects any `g++` reporting a
major version below 10, which is why it exists rather than the build simply calling `cmake`.

Third-party sources are pinned by tag in `CMakeLists.txt`, and `docs/sbom.spdx.json` - the
SPDX 2.3 bill of materials - is generated from those pins by `tools/make_sbom.py`. CI runs
`tools/make_sbom.py --check`, so a dependency added to the build without an entry in the
table above turns the tree red instead of passing quietly.

| The primal push of the crossover (#343): every nonbasic variable starts at the interior point's value and is pushed to its nearer bound along `B^-1 a_k` with a ratio test against the basic variables, a blocking basic leaving the basis, so the point stays feasible and the primal loop finishes from a vertex of the optimal face | Bixby, Operations Research 50 (2002), sec. 4; Andersen & Ye, Management Science 42 (1996); Megiddo, *On finding primal- and dual-optimal bases*, ORSA J.

Of the work once listed here as "Phases 6 onwards", restarted PDHG, the Mehrotra
predictor-corrector, Gomory mixed-integer and lifted cover cuts, Devex pricing (#66, the
default) and the Harris ratio test (#67, opt-in) have all landed and are in the table
above. Not landed: the Forrest-Tomlin update (Forrest & Tomlin 1972; what ships is the
product form of the inverse with refactorization forced by an accuracy check),
mixed-integer rounding cuts, and cuts below the root.

## 4. Machine-checkable evidence

### 4.1 What the binary actually links against

Regenerated at **Phase 2**, commit `12fa98b`. The Phase 1 text predicted that zlib would
appear here once the gzip MPS path became real; it now does, on both platforms, which is
what that prediction was for.

Windows 11, **GCC 16.1.0 (MSYS2 UCRT64), Release**:

The Windows C runtime plus **zlib1.dll**. Note that the `-static` flag added in Phase 1 does
not cover this one: MSYS2 provides zlib as an import library (`libz.dll.a`), so the Windows
`.exe` is no longer self-contained. That is recorded rather than fixed. Windows is the
convenience build; Linux is what CI gates and what the claim rests on. It is logged as
judgement call 7 below.

The Linux build is the authoritative one. Produced by the `provenance` job on
**ubuntu-latest, GCC (runner default), Release**, run 32867892122:

```
$ ldd build/sankhya
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007f2012bf2000)
        libz.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so.1 (0x00007f2012b07000)
        libstdc++.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007f2012800000)
        libm.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 (0x00007f2012717000)
        libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f2012ad9000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f2012400000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f2012bf4000)

$ ldd build/sankhya | grep -Ei 'cbc|clp|highs|scip|soplex|glpk|lpsolve|osqp|ortools|gurobi|cplex|xpress'
OK: no solver library is linked
```

zlib, the C++ runtime, libc and libm - and, on a build with `SANKHYA_WITH_OPENMP` on (the
default, #57), the compiler's own OpenMP runtime, `libgomp` with GCC, which the listing
above predates. Nothing else.

That grep is a **gate**, not a comment: the `provenance` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
exits non-zero if any linked library name matches a known solver. The claim cannot silently
rot.

### 4.2 The full link line

Asked of Ninja directly so it cannot drift from what was really executed.

Linux, from the CI `provenance` job (run 32867892122):

```
$ ninja -C build -t commands sankhya | tail -1
/usr/bin/c++ -O3 -DNDEBUG -Wl,--dependency-file=CMakeFiles/sankhya-cli.dir/link.d     CMakeFiles/sankhya-cli.dir/apps/sankhya-cli/main.cpp.o     -o sankhya     libsankhya_core.a     _deps/fmt-build/libfmt.a     /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so
```

Windows, same command on the local tree:

```
$ ninja -C build -t commands sankhya-cli | tail -1
g++ -O3 -DNDEBUG -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -static     CMakeFiles/sankhya-cli.dir/apps/sankhya-cli/main.cpp.obj     -o sankhya.exe     -Wl,--out-implib,libsankhya.dll.a     libsankhya_core.a     _deps/fmt-build/libfmt.a     C:/msys64/ucrt64/lib/libz.dll.a
```

Three artifacts on each platform: our own core, fmt, and the system zlib. CLI11 and
nlohmann/json are header-only and appear as includes rather than archives; they are in the
dependency table above and visible in `CMakeLists.txt`.

### 4.3 SBOM

An SPDX SBOM is generated in CI by the `provenance` job and attached as a build artifact
(`sankhya-sbom.spdx.json`).

## 5. Judgement calls

Decisions where the dependency policy needed interpretation. Per `ENGINEERING_RULES.md`, these are
recorded rather than silently made.

| # | Question | Decision | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Does imitating a familiar solver *log layout* (iteration / objective / primal inf / dual inf / time) cross the line? | Allowed | Interface familiarity, not derivation. The layout is visible in published user manuals and screenshots; no source was consulted. It makes the output readable to the industrial audience that reads such logs daily. Same reasoning as the API-shape allowance in `ENGINEERING_RULES.md`. |
| 2 | Does a string-keyed option table with typed values imitate a solver's API? | Allowed | Explicitly permitted by `ENGINEERING_RULES.md` item 5 (API shape). The shape is create/set/solve/query with string options; the registry, parser and storage are our own. |
| 3 | System zlib is picked up in preference to a fetched copy. Does that weaken the provenance claim? | Acceptable, and recorded | zlib is a compression library under a permissive licence, present on essentially every system. The exact resolved path appears in the link line above, so which copy was used is always visible. |
| 4 | The Windows build links libstdc++ and libgcc **statically** (`-static`). | Deliberate | It removes a start-up failure caused by an older MinGW earlier on PATH, and it makes the dependency list above shorter and easier to audit, not longer. It has no effect on the Linux build, which CI treats as authoritative. |
| 5 | The MPS reader imitates the *file format* of CPLEX/Xpress inputs, and the LP reader imitates the CPLEX LP format. | Allowed | A file format is an interface, not an implementation. `ENGINEERING_RULES.md` item 5 covers API shape for the same reason, and reading a format everyone's solver reads is what makes us drop-in adoptable. Both readers were written from the published format specification and from the textbook reference above; **no solver's reader source was consulted**, which `ENGINEERING_RULES.md` calls out by name as forbidden. |
| 6 | Netlib distributes its LP test set in a packed `emps` encoding, not as plain MPS, and expanding it requires the `emps` decoder Netlib ships alongside the data. Does fetching that decoder cross the red line? | **RESOLVED — allowed, and not vendored.** See row 8, which records how it is actually done. | Logged as OPEN while Phase 2 was in progress, and Phase 2 correctly claimed no Netlib result at the time. It was settled when `bench/runners/fetch_data.py` was written: the decoder is DOWNLOADED AND COMPILED at fetch time rather than committed, so this repository contains no third-party source, and the sha256 of everything downloaded is recorded. `emps` is a file-format converter, not a solver, so it sits outside the red line, and `ENGINEERING_RULES.md` item 6 permits the Netlib dataset of which this is the delivery mechanism. Nothing it produces is linked into SANKHYA. The Netlib results in `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` rest on this decision. See issue #62. |
| 7 | The Windows `.exe` dynamically links `zlib1.dll`, so the Phase 1 claim that it is self-contained no longer holds. | Recorded, not fixed | MSYS2 ships zlib only as an import library, and `-static` cannot statically link what has no static archive. Fixing it would mean forcing the bundled zlib build on Windows, which trades an audit-surface improvement for a divergence between the two platforms' dependency sets. Linux is what CI gates and what the provenance claim rests on; Windows is the convenience build. Revisit at Phase 10 packaging if we ship a Windows binary. |
| 8 | `bench/runners/fetch_data.py` downloads Netlib's `emps.c` decoder and COMPILES it at fetch time. Is that third-party source in the project? | Allowed, and not vendored | Netlib distributes its LP set in a custom compressed encoding, and `emps.c` is the decoder they publish beside it. It is a file-format converter, not a solver, so it is outside the red line. It is downloaded at fetch time rather than committed, so this repository contains no third-party source; its sha256 is recorded in `data/netlib/reference.json`. Nothing it produces is linked into SANKHYA - it runs once, offline, to turn an archive format into plain MPS. |
| 9 | MPS says a negative `UP` bound with no explicit lower bound implies `lower = -inf`. That is documented for continuous columns and **implementation-defined for integer ones**, where established readers disagree. Which reading do we take? | Apply the convention to integer columns too, and warn | Declining to choose was tried first and was worse than either choice: leaving `lower = 0` produces `[0, -5]`, an empty interval, so `Model::validate()` rejected the model and the file could not be loaded **at all** - and the resulting error named crossed bounds, which is the symptom rather than the cause. It also put the C++ reader at odds with `tools/verify_solution.py`, which already applies the convention; two components disagreeing about what the same bytes mean is exactly what that verifier exists to catch, so the disagreement sitting inside the pair weakened the check against every instance carrying such a bound. The warning is kept so the ambiguity stays visible in the log. See issue #8. |
| 10 | The device PDHG (#17) cites the cuPDLP paper for its host/device split, and cuPDLP.jl / cuPDLP-C / cuPDLPx are named on the red line. | Allowed, and recorded | The red line forbids reading solver SOURCE. The arXiv paper is a publication, allowed under item 2 of the policy, and it is the only cuPDLP artefact consulted: no repository of any of the three was opened, and the kernels, the CSR upload and the reduction scheme were written from the paper's description and the CUDA / cuSPARSE / CUB documentation. The iteration itself is the CPU engine's, from CP11 and PDLP. |

## 6. Reproducing this

```bash
scripts/configure.sh build Release
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

On Linux, `ldd build/sankhya`. On Windows, `objdump -p build/sankhya.exe | grep "DLL Name"`.

To reproduce the Phase 2 end-to-end result:

```bash
build/sankhya info demo/crude_blend.mps
build/sankhya solve demo/crude_blend.mps --write-sol blend.sol --stats blend.json
build/sankhya solve demo/crude_blend.lp
```

The MPS and LP files describe the same model; the two solutions must be identical.
