// WHAT PRESOLVE IS FOR. Industrial models are written by modelling systems, not by hand, and
// they arrive full of rows that say nothing: variables already fixed by data, constraints
// that cannot bind given the bounds, rows with a single entry that are really just a bound.
// Solving those is wasted work. PS26119 asks for models with "thousands to millions of
// variables"; on those, what is removed before the simplex starts matters more than the
// pivot rule.
//
// THE DANGEROUS HALF IS POSTSOLVE. A reduction that is slightly wrong does not crash - it
// returns a confident, feasible-looking answer to a DIFFERENT problem. That is the same
// failure class ENGINEERING_RULES.md names as the worst available outcome, alongside reporting
// a MILP's fractional relaxation as optimal. Every reduction here therefore pushes a record
// onto a stack, and postsolve replays that stack in reverse to rebuild a solution to the
// ORIGINAL model. The round-trip is asserted against the exact rational oracle, not assumed.
