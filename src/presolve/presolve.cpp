      // fuzzed instance where `elim` sat AT its own bound (not interior) while `keep` - reached
      // only through fill-in - was genuinely interior: the row's price was decided from elim
      // alone, correctly admissible for elim, while leaving keep's already-computed (but
      // WRONGLY anchored) reduced cost nonzero. y_from_elim, not eliminated_cost/a, is the
      // correct anchor whenever elim itself has other rows of its own - and using it costs
      // nothing in the simpler case, since the two coincide there.
      //
      // UNLIKE A FREE-COLUMN-SINGLETON, THE ELIMINATED COLUMN IS NOT ASSUMED FREE: it keeps its
      // own real bounds, so it - not just the partner - can independently force this row's
      // dual. `min x + 2y s.t. x + y = 4, x,y >= 0` is the minimal case: y sits at its own
      // bound with an admissible sign no matter what the row's dual is, so a check that only
      // asked about y concluded no price was needed - but x is INTERIOR (x = 4), which requires
      // its reduced cost to be EXACTLY zero regardless of y, and that pins the row's dual to a
      // specific value y could never have asked for on its own.

  // downgraded perold, greenbea and greenbeb to `feasible` for a dual violation of 0.71,
  // and wrote a .sol file the independent verifier passed. The solver was refusing to
  // certify an answer over numbers that no longer existed.
  //
  // This pass replaced one that recomputed the REMOVED columns only, on the grounds that
  // a survivor's reduced cost was already right and recomputing it through different
  // floating-point operations turned an exact 0.0 on a free column of capri into -1.1e-16,
  // which the verifier's |d| * slack product, with slack infinite, evaluated to inf. That
  // pass was too narrow - a survivor sharing a row postsolve priced has a reduced cost the
  // engine never saw - and its instinct was right; see the selection below.
  //
  // Everything above sets col_dual as records are replayed, in reverse order, and several
  // of those replays price a column with reduced_cost_of() at a moment when some row it
  // touches still carries the placeholder dual of 0 - the free-column-singleton and
  // doubleton rows are only priced in the passes that follow. A column whose record ran
  // before those passes keeps a reduced cost computed against a row dual that later
  // changed. On ganges the reported d disagrees with c - A^T y by 0.71; on perold by 0.71,
  // greenbeb by 6.4. The point is right on every one - HiGHS agrees to 1e-10 - and the
  // certificate handed out with it is not, which is the exact failure class postsolve is
  // dangerous for.
  //
  // d = c - A^T y is not one property of the answer among several; it is the definition of
  // d. So once every row dual is final, every column's reduced cost that presolve could
  // have changed is set from it. A column the passes above priced correctly is unchanged
  // by this; a column they priced against a stale row dual is corrected; and if a ROW dual
  // is itself wrong, that now shows up as a sign violation on the columns it prices -
  // which the status check and the verifier both test - instead of hiding behind a
  // reduced cost that agreed with nothing.
  //
  // NOT EVERY COLUMN, THOUGH. A survivor that presolve never touched keeps the engine's
  // reduced cost, and the reason is the one the removed-columns-only pass gave: the
  // engine's 0.0 on a basic column is exact by construction, and recomputing it through
  // terms of order 1e+07 replaces that fact with a rounding residue. grow22 on the CI gate:
  // XI1408, basic and interior by 1.3e+05, recomputed to -4.6e-11, and the verifier's
  // complementarity product |d| * slack read 6.1e-06 against an absolute 1e-06. A column
  // is recomputed when presolve could have changed the quantity: it was removed; or it has
  // an original entry in a folded row (its cost was adjusted and its coefficients filled
  // in, so the engine priced a different column, and that holds even when the folded row's
