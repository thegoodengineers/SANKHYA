// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. PDHG converges at a rate governed by the operator norm of the
// constraint matrix, so on a badly scaled model - a refinery LP mixing flows in tonnes with
// qualities in parts per million is the canonical case - it does not converge in any useful
// number of iterations. Preconditioning is not an optimisation there, it is what makes the
// method work.
//
// BOTH ENGINES USE THIS, which is why it lives in src/la and not under src/pdhg. An earlier
// version of this comment claimed "the simplex is largely indifferent to scaling because it
// pivots on exact ratios". That is true of the algebra and false of the arithmetic, and the
// Netlib medium tier disproved it: 18 of 24 failures were the identical message "basis
// became singular", concentrated on the badly scaled corner of the set, and fit1d failed
// after 23 iterations - far too early to be accumulated drift. Equilibrating first took that
// tier from 26/50 to 37/50. See issue #49.
