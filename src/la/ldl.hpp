//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. The normal equations A Theta A^T of an interior-point method are symmetric
// positive definite (semi-definite at the limit), and their sparsity pattern never changes
// across iterations while their values change every one. So the work splits in two:
// analyze() computes a fill-reducing ordering, the elimination tree and the exact pattern of
// L once; factorize() fills in the numbers of that pattern, as often as the IPM likes.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. Not a general indefinite factorization: there is no Bunch-Kaufman
// pivoting. A pivot below the regularization threshold is replaced by the threshold, which
// is the standard IPM remedy (Altman & Gondzio) and turns an exactly singular system into a
// slightly perturbed nonsingular one; the count of such pivots is reported so the caller can
// see how much the factors deviate from the matrix. Iterative refinement (the solve is cheap)
// recovers most of what the perturbation costs.
