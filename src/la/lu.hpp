//     a column-singleton pivot skip the columns it crosses (#463, lu_eliminate.cpp).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Phase 2's DenseLu rebuilds and refactorizes an m x m dense array on
// EVERY pivot: O(m^2) memory traffic and O(m^3) flops per iteration. At m = 800 that is
// 5 MB and 1.7e8 flops per iteration, and a real basis of 800 columns holds perhaps 3000
// nonzeros - so better than 99% of that work is spent on structural zeros. This class
// factorizes the sparsity pattern instead.
//
// WHAT THE FACTORIZATION IS. Gaussian elimination with an arbitrary pivot ORDER rather
// than an arbitrary pivot SEQUENCE: at step k a pivot (r_k, c_k) is chosen from the active
// submatrix, and every remaining active row with a nonzero in column c_k is updated by
//
//     row_i  :=  row_i  -  mult_{i,k} * row_{r_k},     mult_{i,k} = a[i][c_k] / a[r_k][c_k]
//
// Writing M_k for that transformation, the elimination gives  M_{m-1} ... M_0 A = U, with
// U upper triangular under the permutations r and c. So  A = M_0^-1 ... M_{m-1}^-1 U, and
// the two solves fall out of that identity directly - see the derivations in lu.cpp, which
// are written out in full because a sign or an ordering error here does not crash. It
// produces duals that look plausible, prices the wrong column, and stops the simplex at a
// non-optimal vertex with a confident "optimal".
//
// STABILITY. Markowitz alone will happily choose a pivot of 1e-14 because it produces no
// fill. Every candidate must therefore also satisfy
//
//     |a[r][c]|  >=  tau * max_i |a[i][c]|          tau = tol::kMarkowitzThreshold
//
// which is the classic trade of a little fill for a bound on element growth.
//
// VERIFICATION. DenseLu is NOT deleted. It stays in the tree as the reference oracle: the
// fuzz tests factorize the same matrix both ways and require the FTRAN and BTRAN results to
// agree. That is the only cheap defence against a permutation bug, which is otherwise
// invisible.

  // Reference: Dantzig & Orchard-Hays, "The product form for the inverse in the simplex
  // method", Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to Computation 8 (1954).
  //
  // A simplex pivot replaces ONE column of the basis. Refactorizing all of it to absorb a
  // rank-one change is the dominant per-iteration cost once the factorization itself is
  // sparse. Replacing column p of B with a, and writing alpha = B^-1 a,
  //
  //     B_new = B (I + (alpha - e_p) e_p^T) = B E
  //
  // so the factorization of B is kept and E is recorded. After k updates
  // B_k = B_0 E_1 ... E_k, and the two solves follow directly:
  //
  //     FTRAN   x = E_k^-1 ... E_1^-1 (B_0^-1 b)     base solve first, etas OLDEST first
  //     BTRAN   x = B_0^-T (E_1^-T ... E_k^-T b)     etas NEWEST first, then the base solve
  //
  // The orders are opposite and neither is symmetric with the other. Getting one backwards
  // produces a vector of entirely plausible magnitude - see the tests, which check both
  // against a from-scratch factorization of the updated basis rather than against each
  // other.
  //
  // WHAT THIS COSTS. Refactorizing every iteration had one real virtue: no update error
  // could accumulate, so any wrong answer was the simplex's fault. Updates reintroduce
  // drift, which is why update() refuses a numerically unsafe pivot and why
  // should_refactorize() exists. Both are part of the feature, not optional extras.

  // -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // Basis update (Forrest-Tomlin)
  //
  // Reference: Forrest & Tomlin, "Updated triangular factors of the basis to maintain
  // sparsity in the product form simplex method", Mathematical Programming 2 (1972), via
  // the derivation in Huangfu & Hall, "Novel update techniques for the revised simplex
  // method" (ERGO 13-001, 2012), section 2.1 - eq. (11) onward is what this follows.
  //
  // update() above pays for the pivot on every SOLVE: the eta file is read in full, one
  // eta per update, whether or not the right-hand side touches most of it (issue #279).
  // This path pays for the pivot mostly AT THE UPDATE instead, by folding the new column
  // into U directly and leaving only a much smaller correction (the row eta below) for
  // solves to apply.
  //
  //   1. alpha already IS B^-1 a (the caller's FTRAN), so the column L^-1 P a - which is
  //      what replaces the leaving position's column of U - is recovered by multiplying the
  //      CURRENT U into alpha reindexed by step (U * alpha_by_step = that column, read the
  //      solve the other way), rather than resolving a again.
  //   2. That column, installed as every OTHER step's reference to the leaving step, is
  //      always valid regardless of where the leaving step's own diagonal ends up - so it is
  //      moved to the LAST position, and everything between its old and new position shifts
  //      down by one to keep the permutation a bijection (a pure relabelling: no entry any
  //      OTHER step owns is read or written by this).
  //   3. The leaving step's OWN old row, now invalid at the last position (nothing can
  //      validly reference it from there), is eliminated - not by rewriting other steps'
  //      rows, but by a single row transformation R computed via a partial BTRAN through U
  //      alone (Forrest & Tomlin's r = e_p^T - u_pp * (e_p^T U^-1), the "row spike" the issue
  //      names). R is applied between L and U on every later solve, exactly where PFI's
  //      product form is applied outside both - see ft_apply_retas().
  //
  // L is never touched. R grows by one small vector per update, same shape as update()'s
  // eta file but built from U's own sparsity rather than the dense-ish alpha, which is
  // where the win comes from; should_refactorize() caps it the same way.
  //
  // Only one of update() / update_forrest_tomlin() may be used on a given factorization;
  // calling the other afterwards fails rather than silently mixing the two schemes (both
  // directions refuse - see update() above and the guard at the top of this one).
  //
  // ACCEPTANCE THRESHOLD. update() rejects a pivot too small relative to max|alpha|, in the
  // basis's own coordinates. This rejects a pivot too small relative to max|spike|, where
  // spike = L^-1 P a: the same relative test, but against a vector on a different scale
  // (already partially reduced through U). The two modes' "declined as unsafe" counts are
  // therefore not directly comparable.
  //
  // KNOWN COST. ft_row_/ft_col_ are vector<vector<pair<Index,double>>>: correct and simple,
  // but two heap allocations per step at every ft_init() and pointer-chasing on every solve,
  // rather than the one contiguous array u_start_/u_steps_ gives the product form. A CSR
  // layout with per-row slack (Koberstein 2005, ch. 5) would keep this O(fill) instead of
  // O(m) allocations and let solves walk one array; not done here.
