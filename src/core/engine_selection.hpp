// SANKHYA - which LP engine `algorithm=auto` means (#284): a rule-based selection from
// the model's shape, returned as a structured decision with the rule and the measurement
// behind it, so the choice is explainable and reproducible rather than a threshold buried
// in the dispatcher.
//
// The rules encode MEASUREMENTS, not intuition, and every threshold below names the CSV it
// comes from. Where the evidence does not reach, the rule says so in its reason. No machine
// learning; the first version is deliberately a short table anyone can read.

///   has 6,071 rows; at 20,000 rows on both generated shapes it hits the 120 s limit where

///   which times out on them while the interior point solves them; the limit is set where
///   the Netlib evidence ends, not where the generated evidence begins, because dfl001
///   (6,071 rows) solves in 47 s on the dual and not at all on the interior point at 120 s.
/// - kIpmNonzeroFloor: a dense model below the row limit goes to the interior point:
///   maros-r7 (3,136 rows, 144,848 nonzeros) times out on the dual simplex and solves in
///   14 s on the interior point with crossover; no Netlib instance under 100,000 nonzeros
///   is measured to prefer it (fit2p, 50,284 nonzeros, times out on it).
/// - kIpmDensityRowFloor: the density rule applies from this many rows. Its evidence is a
///   basis factorization the dual simplex cannot afford, and a model with a few hundred
///   rows has no such basis however many nonzeros its columns hold: fit2d (25 rows, 10,500
///   columns, 129,018 nonzeros after presolve) solves in 0.09 s on the dual simplex against
///   0.18 s on the interior point with crossover. maros-r7, the rule's reason, has 3,136.
/// - kPdhgRowFloor: from 100,000 rows the direct factorization is out of reach
///   (`scale-e134aeb.csv`: the interior point produces no output on the 100,000-row random
///   shape and hits the limit on the staircase; PDHG reaches the optimum to 1e-7 on both),
