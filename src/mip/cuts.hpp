// SANKHYA - cutting planes for the branch and bound (#23).
//
// THE FAILURE MODE THIS FILE MUST NOT HAVE. A cut that is very slightly invalid removes the
// optimum, and the search then PROVES that the second-best answer is optimal: status
// `optimal`, point integral and feasible, bound equal to objective. Nothing about the output
// looks wrong, and no test that only checks self-consistency can see it.
//
// So every family added here carries two obligations, both in tests/unit/test_cuts.cpp:
//
//   1. a validity test against the EXACT optimum from the rational oracle, checked in exact
//      arithmetic, asserting the cut does not separate it;
//   2. a negative control - a deliberately invalid cut the same harness must reject - because
//      a validity test that has never failed is not evidence that it can fail.
//
// Two families live here, both generated once at the root and both OFF by default
// (`enable_root_cuts`; the measurement behind the default is in the option's description):
//
//   - lifted knapsack cover cuts, on rows of the form sum(a_j x_j) <= b over binaries, with
//     exact sequential lifting through a 0/1 knapsack dynamic programme;
//   - Gomory mixed-integer cuts, from the tableau row of each fractional basic integer
//     column, reconstructed from the final basis of the root LP.
