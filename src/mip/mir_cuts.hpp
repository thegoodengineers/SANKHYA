// SANKHYA - mixed-integer rounding (MIR) cuts (#221).
//
// A Gomory cut comes from a row of the simplex tableau, which is a dense, numerically
// fragile object; that is why the root Gomory cuts cost a proof on the MIPLIB A/B and are
// off by default. An MIR cut comes from a row of the MODEL: bound-substitute the variables so
// every one is non-negative, move the continuous part to the right-hand side, divide by a
// divisor, and apply the mixed-integer rounding inequality. The coefficients are the model's
// own, which is why MIR is the workhorse cut of every modern MILP solver (Marchand & Wolsey,
// "Aggregation and mixed integer rounding to solve MIPs", Operations Research 49 (2001);
// Nemhauser & Wolsey, "A recursive procedure to generate all cuts for 0-1 mixed integer
// programs", Math. Programming 46 (1990) for the inequality itself).
//
// THE INEQUALITY. For  sum_j a_j y_j <= b + s,  y integer and non-negative, s >= 0, with
// f0 = frac(b) in (0, 1) and f_j = frac(a_j):
//     sum_j ( floor(a_j) + max(0, f_j - f0) / (1 - f0) ) y_j  <=  floor(b) + s / (1 - f0).
// Dividing the base inequality by a divisor delta before rounding gives a family; the
// divisor is tried at 1 and at the coefficients of the fractional integer variables, and
// the most violated member is returned, in the model's original variables and in the
// `Cut` convention (sum coeff_j x_j <= rhs). A row whose continuous variables sit inside
// their bounds at the LP point is AGGREGATED with other rows to eliminate them, one at a
// time up to a depth of six, and the inequality is tried on every intermediate aggregate
// (Marchand & Wolsey 2001, sec. 3); the most violated cut over all depths is kept.
