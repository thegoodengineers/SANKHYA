// THE TREE DOES NOT COPY THE MODEL. One working Model is built once, and a node is entered
// by applying the chain of bound changes from the root and left by undoing them. A node
// therefore costs O(depth) to enter, not O(nonzeros), and the constraint matrix exists once
// no matter how large the tree grows.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES BY DEFAULT, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. Reliability branching (#69) is the
// default rule. The root cutting planes in cuts.hpp (#159) exist and are OFF unless
// `enable_root_cuts` is set, because they were measured to cost proofs at the benchmark's
// time limit. There is no node presolve beyond simple propagation and no parallelism. The
// order those arrived in was deliberate: a cut that is very slightly invalid removes the
// optimum and the search then proves the wrong answer, confidently, so a plain, correct
// search came first and is what makes each addition checkable.

// THE OBJECTIVE IS INTEGRAL MORE OFTEN THAN IT LOOKS (#221). On the 30-instance MIPLIB set,
// four of the six instances that hold the published optimum without proving it have an
// objective that every integer solution evaluates to an integer: noswot's costs are
// integers on integer columns; b-ball, opt1217 and rlp1 minimise one continuous column that
// a single row defines from integer columns with integer coefficients. Their bounds sat at
// 14 against an incumbent of 15 (rlp1), -43 against -41 (noswot): a bound that no integer
// solution can attain is one the search may round, and nothing here knew the objective was
// integral. Both patterns are detected once, and every relaxation bound is rounded up to
// the next multiple of the step before it is compared to the incumbent, so nodes in
// (14, 15) are fathomed and a bound above 14 proves 15. Wolsey, "Integer Programming"
// (1998), sec. 7.3; the defining-row case is what presolve's free-column-singleton
// substitution would produce if it ran on these models.
