// SANKHYA - conflict analysis for the branch and bound: learning, from a node proved
// infeasible, which of its branching decisions were to blame, and pruning every later node
// that repeats them (#292).
//
// References, written from the literature:
//   Achterberg, "Conflict analysis in mixed integer programming", Discrete Optimization 4(1),
//     2007 - conflicts from infeasible LPs and from propagation, and their use in the tree
//   Achterberg, "Constraint Integer Programming" (thesis, 2007), ch. 11 - the same, in SCIP
//   Witzig, Berthold & Heinz, "Experiments with conflict analysis in mixed integer
//     programming", CPAIOR 2017 - the dual-ray (Farkas) proof as the source of an LP conflict
//   Junker, "QuickXplain", AAAI 2004, and the deletion filter it improves on - minimising a
//     conflict by dropping one element at a time and re-checking
//
// WHAT A CONFLICT IS HERE. A set of bound literals, each "x_j <= v" or "x_j >= v" on an
// INTEGER column with an integral v, such that the model's rows, its global column bounds and
// those literals together admit no point. The learned constraint is the bound disjunction
// "at least one literal is false", which for an integer column means x_j >= v + 1 or
// x_j <= v - 1. It is GLOBALLY valid: it was proved from the global bounds, not from the
// node it was found at, so it may prune anywhere in the tree.
//
// WHY IT CANNOT CUT OFF A FEASIBLE POINT. A literal set is stored only after it is checked
// again from scratch, on the global bounds, by one of two sound arguments: bound propagation
// empties a box, or a Farkas multiplier vector - checked here, conservatively, not taken on
// the LP's word - shows the rows cannot be met inside the propagated box. Neither argument
// is weaker than the one that pruned the original node. Removing a stored conflict only
// ever weakens pruning, which is why the database may forget.
