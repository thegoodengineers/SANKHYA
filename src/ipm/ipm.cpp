//
// References:
//   Mehrotra, S., "On the implementation of a primal-dual interior point method", SIAM J.
//     Optimization 2 (1992), 575-601 - the predictor-corrector and the centering rule.
//   Wright, S.J., "Primal-Dual Interior-Point Methods", SIAM (1997), ch. 10-11 - the

//
// THE FORM SOLVED. The same one the simplex uses:  [A | -I] [x; s] = 0  with bounds on every
// component, l <= x <= u for the structurals and row_lower <= s <= row_upper for the
// logicals. A finite lower bound contributes a slack s_l = x - l >= 0 with multiplier
// z_l >= 0, a finite upper bound s_u = u - x >= 0 with z_u >= 0, and the dual constraint
// reads c - Abar^T y - z_l + z_u = 0. Free variables have neither and are held by the
// primal regularization alone.
//
// Every Newton system reduces to the normal equations  (Abar Theta Abar^T + delta I) dy = r
// with Theta diagonal, which is SPD and, because Abar carries -I, at least as well
// conditioned as Theta_s on the logical block. The sparse LDL^T of la/ldl.hpp is analyzed
// once and refactorized every iteration.
//
// WHAT THIS METHOD DOES NOT DO. It produces no basis, so it cannot warm-start branch and
// bound and the simplex remains the node engine. It does not certify infeasibility or
// unboundedness: when it fails to converge it says so and hands back a numerical error,
// never a claim it cannot prove. Both are stated in the option's description.
