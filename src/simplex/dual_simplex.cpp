//
// DUAL STEEPEST EDGE (#411). The leaving row r is the basic variable furthest outside its
// bounds, measured against how far the duals must move to fix it: the dual step along
// rho_r = e_r^T B^-1 changes the duals by t rho_r, so the honest measure of row r's
// infeasibility is delta_r^2 / ||rho_r||^2. Devex approximates ||rho_r||^2 with a reference
// framework and resets it when it drifts; steepest edge maintains it exactly. After a pivot
// on (r, q) with alpha = B^-1 a_q the new inverse's rows are
//     rho_r'  =  rho_r / alpha_r,            rho_i'  =  rho_i - (alpha_i / alpha_r) rho_r,
// so, writing w_i = ||rho_i||^2 and tau = B^-1 rho_r (one extra FTRAN, the cross term
// rho_i . rho_r = e_i^T B^-1 rho_r = tau_i),
//     w_r'  =  w_r / alpha_r^2,
//     w_i'  =  w_i  -  2 (alpha_i / alpha_r) tau_i  +  (alpha_i / alpha_r)^2 w_r,
// with w_r taken as the norm the BTRAN of this very iteration produced, rho_r . rho_r, so a
// drift in the stored weight is corrected at the row that just left rather than carried.
// The weights start exact: 1 on the slack basis, and one BTRAN per row on a warm basis up to
// kDualSteepestEdgeExactInitRows rows (beyond that, 1, which is Devex's start too). A
// weight that comes back non-positive or non-finite sends every weight back to the exact
// start rather than pricing on a lie.
//
// WHY A SECOND METHOD. The primal simplex keeps a primal feasible point and improves the
// objective; the dual keeps every reduced cost sign-admissible and reduces the primal
// infeasibility. Branch and bound is where that difference is worth a second implementation:
// a child node is the parent with ONE bound moved, so the parent's optimal basis is still
// dual feasible at the child but no longer primal feasible - exactly the state the dual
// starts from, and typically a few pivots from the child's optimum. The primal has to
// re-solve from the slack basis, or run a phase 1 from a basis that is now infeasible.
// Measured on the MIPLIB subset before this landed: every node was a cold primal solve.
//
// THE SHAPE. Everything below runs over the state simplex_core.hpp declares: the same
// working problem in [A | -I] form, the same LU factors and product-form update, the same
// refactorization ladder and basis repair, the same reporting. What is specific to the
// dual is the choice of leaving ROW first (dual pricing, by primal infeasibility weighted
// with dual devex), the pivot row r of B^-1 [A | -I] from one BTRAN, the ratio test over
// the REDUCED COSTS with bound flipping, and what to do about a starting basis that is not
// dual feasible.
//
// DUAL INFEASIBILITY AT THE START. A nonbasic column at its lower bound with a negative
// reduced cost is dual infeasible; if it has an upper bound it is simply moved there, and if
// it has none an ARTIFICIAL upper bound is invented so that it can be (Koberstein sec. 4.5).
// The dual then solves that boxed problem. If at its optimum no column sits on an artificial
// bound, the boxes changed nothing and the answer stands; if one does, the boxes are removed
// and the PRIMAL loop finishes from that basis, which is primal feasible for the true bounds
// on every row but the ones the moved columns touch. No answer is ever reported about the
// boxed problem: the boxes are gone before finish() runs, on every exit.
//
// THE RATIO TEST'S PIVOT FLOOR IS RELATIVE TO THE ROW (#244), and the optimal exit sums
// what its wrong-signed reduced costs price before it claims anything (see the loop). What
// is not here is the Harris variant of the dual ratio test. Cost perturbation against
// dual degeneracy IS here (COST PERTURBATION, below): a stall perturbs the nonbasic costs
// and iterates on, and only a stall that survives that hands the basis to the primal loop,
// which has its own anti-degeneracy machinery - so a stall costs iterations and never a
// wrong answer.
