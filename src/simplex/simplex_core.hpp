// The class carries everything both methods need - the working problem in [A | -I] form,

  // DEVEX IS THE DEFAULT, since the basis chain changed under it. It was opt-in while it
  // drove grow22 and scsd8 to "basis became singular" - the weights were audited and one
  // real defect fixed (kDevexAccuracyFactor), and grow22 still failed at iteration 679; #67
  // (Harris) did not rescue it. The failure class itself was then removed by #144 (the
  // Markowitz search no longer declares a basis singular for want of budget) and #147
  // (rank-deficient bases are repaired rather than abandoned), and the comment that stood
  // here said this should be re-measured the moment the conditioning chain changed. It was:
  //
  //   Netlib medium tier, 120 s, dba3a65 (#160 + #162), one option changed per run
  //     dantzig           46/50 PASS, 49 optimal, 0 failures, 51968 iterations, 191.0 s
  //     devex             46/50 PASS, 49 optimal, 0 failures, 34580 iterations, 128.0 s
  //     devex + harris    46/50 PASS, 49 optimal, 0 failures, 38352 iterations, 128.5 s
  //     dantzig + harris  46/50 PASS, 49 optimal, 0 failures, 51547 iterations, 274.8 s
  //   (iterations and time over the 49 instances every rule solves; d6cube times out under
  //   all four; grow22 and scsd8 solve under devex in 1324 and 1790 iterations)
  //
  // Same answers, a third fewer iterations, a third less time, and the extra BTRAN per
  // iteration is paid for on every instance where it matters. Dantzig stays selectable so
  // this table can be regenerated (bench/results/netlib-medium-dba3a65-*.csv).

  // MEASURED, Netlib medium tier, Dantzig pricing (the default) both ways: the textbook rule
  // passes 41/50; Harris passes 40/50, trading grow22 (was optimal, primal infeasibility
  // 8.904e-07 under Harris - just over kPrimalFeasibility) for no singular-basis win at all.
  // The three singular-basis failures (d6cube, grow15, pilot4) are IDENTICAL under both
  // rules; Harris relaxes ratio-test ties, and none of these three fail on a tie. Tightening
  // kHarrisRelaxation by 10x (0.01 * kPrimalFeasibility instead of 0.1x) does not change
  // grow22's outcome either - the regression comes from pass two choosing a different pivot
  // altogether on this instance, not from the size of the relaxation.
  //
  // This matches what #67's own comment thread already found when Harris was first tried
  // against devex ("measures null") - it is not a devex-specific interaction, it reproduces
  // under plain Dantzig too. The textbook rule stays the default so the medium pass rate does
  // not drop (ENGINEERING_RULES.md); Harris is implemented, cited, tested and selectable
