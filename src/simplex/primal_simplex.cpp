//     Programming 5, 1-28 - the two-pass ratio test (issue #67): pass one finds how far a

//     pivot among rows that still block within that relaxed limit, trading a controlled,
//     bounded amount of infeasibility for a far better-conditioned basis.
//
// FORMULATION. Every row gets a logical variable, so the working system is
//
//     [ A | -I ] [ x ; s ] = 0,     row_lower <= s <= row_upper,
//                                   col_lower <= x <= col_upper
//
// with n structural variables indexed [0, n) and m logical variables indexed [n, n + m).
// A basis is m of those columns. The all-logical basis B = -I is available for free, is
// always nonsingular, and is where every solve starts.
//
// WHY NO BIG-M. The obvious phase 1 adds an artificial variable per row with a large cost
// M. It is easy to write and it is a numerical trap: M has to dominate the real objective
// to force feasibility first, so the cost vector spans M and the original coefficients at
// once, which is precisely how you manufacture an ill-conditioned pricing step. Too small
// an M silently returns an infeasible point as optimal. There is no value of M that is
// right for every model, and the problem statement specifically asks about ill-conditioned
// instances.
//
// Instead phase 1 minimises the piecewise-linear sum of bound violations of the basic
// variables directly. The starting basis is the slack basis, no artificial columns are
// introduced at all, and the phase-1 gradient is exactly -1 / 0 / +1 per basic variable.
// It is bounded below by zero by construction, so "phase 1 stalls with no improving
// column" is a proof of infeasibility rather than an inconclusive result.
//
// SCOPE. Devex pricing (default) with Dantzig behind an option and a Bland fallback, the
// Harris two-pass ratio test with long-step bound flipping (opt-in, issue #67, below),
// bound perturbation on a degenerate stall (#136; the dual loop's cost perturbation is its
// analogue), and a sparse Markowitz LU updated in product form, refactorized when an FTRAN
// residual check says the factors have drifted (#50). The full dense refactorization this
// file started with survives as DenseLu, the oracle the sparse LU is tested against.

  // Method", section 9.4; Suhl & Suhl, "Computing sparse LU factorizations for large-scale
  // linear programming bases", ORSA J. Computing 2 (1990), which describes the same patch.
  //
  // WHY THIS IS THE FIX RATHER THAN BETTER PIVOTING. refactorize() already retries the
  // ordering all the way to full partial pivoting (tau = 1), so by the time it gives up the
  // basis is not badly ordered, it is RANK DEFICIENT: some of its columns are linear
  // combinations of the others, and no pivot order can make a singular matrix invertible.
  // Measured on the full Netlib set, 13 of the 24 failures ended exactly here, including the
  // whole pilot family - the largest single cause of failure in the benchmark.
  //
  // THE PATCH. If k columns are dependent, exactly k rows were left uncovered by the
  // elimination. Evict those k columns and put in the LOGICAL (slack) of each uncovered row.
  // A logical is the unit column e_i, so it pivots on row i against nothing else: the
  // repaired basis is nonsingular by construction, not by luck, and re-factorizing it
  // succeeds for a structural reason rather than a numerical one.
  //
  // WHAT IT COSTS, stated because it is not free. The evicted variables are parked on a
  // bound, which moves the current point, so the basis afterwards may be primal infeasible
  // where it was feasible before. That is recoverable - phase 1 exists for exactly this - and
  // it is unambiguously better than the alternative, which was to return kNumericalError and
  // no answer at all. It is a REPAIR, not a free lunch, and the counters report how often it
  // fired so a run that limps to an answer cannot be mistaken for one that never stumbled.
  // TWO GUARDS, AND THEY ASK DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. The stall guard asks whether the repair is
  // rescuing this solve or looping on it: a repair moves the point, so the next iteration
  // should be able to pivot, and repairs that keep arriving at the same iteration are not

  // the union of the two is what the pass rate is built on. A portfolio has to share the
  // caller's time limit rather than spend it twice. The old code spent it twice - a
  // time-limited scaled solve triggered a full unscaled retry, so a 120 s limit ran for 241 s
  // on every timed-out instance - and degen3 "passed" only that way: 120 s wasted in a
  // scaled stall of 265,000 iterations, then an unscaled solve that takes 6 seconds.
  //
  // So the scaled attempt gets half the limit and the retry gets whatever is left. Half is
  // not tuned; it is the split that guarantees the retry a real share when the first attempt
  // fails outright. What it costs is any model that scaling solves in more than half the
  // budget. On the full Netlib set at a 120 s limit the scaled attempt needs up to 55 s on a
  // cool machine (pilot87 54.4 s, fit2p 50.2 s, bench/results/netlib-full-59ac6e3.csv), so
  // the half share is the binding constraint on the two largest solvable instances whenever
  // the machine is slower than that (#172). A caller who knows better sets a larger limit or
  // turns scaling off.
  //
  // THE ROUTE IS RECORDED (#172). Under a time limit the clock decides whether the scaled
  // attempt finishes, and with it which attempt's iterations the answer carries: fit2p took
  // 10,432 scaled iterations on one machine and, on one 1.5x slower, 5,290 unscaled ones
  // after the scaled attempt ran out its share - same objective to 1e-11, both verified. A
  // time limit cannot be made clock-independent, so the choice it made is written into the
