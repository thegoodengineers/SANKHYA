// SANKHYA - a model with nonlinear parts, and what class of problem it is (#296).
//
// THE FROZEN MODEL IS NOT CHANGED. A NonlinearModel HOLDS a sankhya::Model for everything the
// existing engines already understand - the columns with their bounds and integrality, the
// linear rows, the linear and quadratic objective - and adds an expression graph over the same
// columns for what they do not: a nonlinear objective term and nonlinear constraints. There is
// no second variable model to keep in step with the first (#296 item 5), and an LP or MILP
// never passes through an expression tree it does not need (item 1).
//
// WHO READS IT. The convex Condat-Vu engine for linear constraints (#226, convex_nlp.hpp) and
// the general NLP interior point (NLP stage 2, nlp_solve.hpp). Classifying a model says what
// it is; which engine can solve it is those entry points' decision, each stated there.
