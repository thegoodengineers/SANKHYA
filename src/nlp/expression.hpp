// SANKHYA - nonlinear expressions: representation, evaluation, derivatives, convexity (#296).
//
// WHAT THIS IS. The representation a nonlinear objective or constraint needs before any
// engine can be asked to solve it: a directed acyclic graph of operations over the model's
// columns, evaluated without ever returning NaN as a value, differentiated exactly, and
// classified for convexity by rules that are written down. It is a MODEL layer. It does not
// solve anything, and nothing in the LP / MILP / QP / MIQP engines reads it; those keep the
// Model they have, which stays frozen.
//
// OWNERSHIP. A graph owns every node in one arena, and a node is named by its index. Children
// are created before their parent, so a child's index is always smaller: the graph cannot hold
// a cycle, a reference cannot dangle while the graph lives, and the arena order IS a
// topological order, which is what evaluation walks. Nodes are immutable once created.
//
// SHARING. Construction is hash-consed: asking for an operation that already exists returns
// the existing node. `x1 + x2` built twice is one node, and `y = x1 + x2; y*y + 3*y` refers
// to it twice without copying it. Commutative operations sort their children first, so
// `x + y` and `y + x` are the same node as well.
//
// DERIVATIVES are exact. The gradient is reverse-mode automatic differentiation over the
// graph; the Hessian is forward-over-reverse (a second-order adjoint), one sweep per column
// the expression actually contains, returned as a sparse lower triangle. Griewank and
// Walther, "Evaluating Derivatives", 2nd ed., SIAM 2008, chapters 3 and 5. Finite differences
// exist only as a CHECK on those, and are named as approximations wherever they appear.
//
// CONVEXITY follows the composition rules of disciplined convex programming (Grant, Boyd and
// Ye, "Disciplined convex programming", in Global Optimization, Springer 2006): an atom's
// curvature, its monotonicity over the RANGE its argument can take, and the curvature of the
// argument. Ranges come from interval arithmetic over the column bounds. Anything the rules
// cannot establish is `kUnknown`, never guessed convex.
//
// THREAD SAFETY. Building a graph is single-threaded. Every evaluation function is const and
// writes only into caller-owned vectors, so one graph may be evaluated from several threads at
// once, each with its own output.
