// SANKHYA - the frozen model and solution interface.
//
// FROZEN INTERFACE (ENGINEERING_RULES.md). Model is what every reader produces and every engine
// consumes. Solution is what every engine produces. solve() is the single seam where the
// simplex, PDHG, IPM, QP and branch-and-cut engines plug in. Changing anything in this
// file breaks work in three directories at once, so it does not change without an explicit
// decision recorded in the commit message.
//
// Two design choices here exist purely so that later phases do not force a rewrite:
//
//  1. ROWS CARRY TWO-SIDED BOUNDS. A row is  row_lower[i] <= a_i . x <= row_upper[i].
//     Equality is lower == upper; a <= row has lower = -inf; a >= row has upper = +inf; a
//     free (MPS "N") row that is not the objective has both infinite. This is exactly the
//     shape the MPS RANGES section produces, so the reader never has to invent slack
//     variables, and the dual simplex bound-flipping ratio test in Phase 6 gets the
//     two-sided form it needs for free.
//
//  2. THE QUADRATIC OBJECTIVE AND INTEGRALITY MARKERS ARE PRESENT FROM DAY ONE, even
//     though Phase 2 solves only LPs. An LP simply has an empty hessian and all-continuous
//     columns. This is what "modular and extensible to MIQP/NLP/MINLP" costs at this stage:
//     a few unused fields, versus a model-format migration later.
//
// Objective (before ObjSense is applied):
//     objective_offset  +  c . x  +  0.5 * x^T Q x
// Q is symmetric and stored LOWER-TRIANGULAR INCLUDING THE DIAGONAL. Only the stored half
// is kept; the 0.5 factor and the symmetry are applied by whoever evaluates it. This is
// the QPS convention, so a QPLIB/QPS reader maps onto it without a transformation.

/// starts from, because a ray that begins outside the feasible region proves nothing, and a
/// checker needs both halves.

/// The limit states say yes because they normally stop with an iterate or an incumbent in
/// hand. The one exception is a node limit reached before branch and bound found any integer
/// point, which reports no objective and infinite gaps rather than a point (see
