 * SANKHYA - C API.
 *
 * A C89-compatible surface over the C++ core, for callers that cannot or will not link C++:
 * other languages' FFIs, and the Python bindings that sit on top of this rather than on the
 * C++ types directly. Nothing here exposes a C++ type, a template, or an exception - the
 * whole point is a boundary a `ctypes` script can cross.
 *
 * THE SHAPE IS DELIBERATELY FAMILIAR. create / set / solve / query, string-named options,
 * integer status codes. That is the surface every industrial solver presents, and matching
 * it is what makes this drop-in adoptable for someone with existing CPLEX or Gurobi calling
 * code. Per ENGINEERING_RULES.md that is interface compatibility, not derivation: it is written
 * from the public shape those APIs document, and no solver source was read to produce it.
 *
 * ERRORS ARE RETURNED, NEVER THROWN. Every fallible call returns a sankhya_status. When one
 * is not SANKHYA_OK, sankhya_last_error() carries a human-readable reason for that thread.
 * A C caller cannot catch a C++ exception, so every entry point that could raise one wraps
 * its body and converts.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP. Handles returned by a *_create or *_solve function are owned by the caller and
 * must be released with the matching *_free. Every `const char*` returned by this API points
 * into storage owned by the library and is valid until the next call ON THE SAME THREAD that
 * could replace it - copy it if you need to keep it.
 *
 * THREADING. Handles are not internally synchronised: two threads must not touch one handle
 * at once. Distinct handles in distinct threads are fine, and the error string is
 * thread-local, so concurrent solves do not overwrite each other's diagnostics.
