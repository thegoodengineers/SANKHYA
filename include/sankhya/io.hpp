// SANKHYA - model readers and result writers.
//
// Readers return a status object rather than throwing. A malformed model file is ordinary
// user input, not an exceptional condition, and the CLI, the C API and the Python bindings
// all want the same "where and why" string. Every error carries the file and the 1-based
// line number so a judge pointing us at a broken instance gets a usable message.
//
// Every reader calls Model::validate() before returning success. Per ENGINEERING_RULES.md a
// reader that emits a subtly malformed model produces a plausible-looking wrong optimum rather
// than a crash, and that is the failure mode this project is most exposed to.
