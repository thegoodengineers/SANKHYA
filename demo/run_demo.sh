cat <<'NOTES'
    - These are the small end of Netlib. Nothing here supports a claim about large models.
    - Against HiGHS we agree on the objective on every committed instance and are slower:
      about twice its time on the 50-instance medium tier (docs/BENCHMARKS.md section 4).
      We publish that rather than hide it: the problem statement asks us to compare, not
      to win, and HiGHS is a decade of specialist work. demo/run_sih_demo.sh section 5
      re-measures the comparison live, rather than quoting this line.
    - The CUDA backend is on main and compiles in CI; it has not run on a card, so no GPU
      number is claimed (#19). The first-order engine it ports runs on the CPU.
