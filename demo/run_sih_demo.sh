SANKHYA is a mathematical optimization solver core written from scratch in C++20 for
SIH PS26119, issued by Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals. LP and MILP engines are
implemented and benchmarked, and so is convex QP - end to end from an MPS file with a
QUADOBJ section through to an independently verified answer, demonstrated twice below: a
small hand-checkable QP right after this intro, and a price-impact variant of the crude
blend in section 3. What remains open on QP: no QPLIB-format reader or benchmark harness
yet (only the generic QPS convention any MPS file can carry). MIQP - a quadratic objective
WITH integer variables - is now solved too, by branch and bound over QP relaxations, with
the bound caveat set out in section 6. This script walks the problem statement in its own
order. Where we do not have something, it says so rather than changing the subject.

    The same blend, scheduled in WHOLE units. A refinery does not run a stream at 66.667
    kbbl/day because the arithmetic says so - it runs an integer number of batches, tanks or
    campaign days - and the moment that is written down the problem is neither a QP nor a
    MILP but both at once, which is the class PS26119 names as MIQP.

    Nothing new solves it. It is branch and bound (src/mip/branch_and_bound.cpp) with the
    convex QP engine as the node relaxation instead of the simplex.

    The gap targets are set to ZERO below, so the run has to EXHAUST the tree rather than
    stop once it is close enough. At the default 1e-4 the search meets the target at the
    root and reports optimal within it (#188), which is the ordinary industrial answer; a
    zero target is the harder thing and the only one worth demonstrating here: finding
    66.67 is easy, PROVING nothing better exists is the search.

    This does not close that gap - one instance is not a benchmark suite - but it is a live
    demonstration at a size none of the case studies above reach, on an LP whose optimum is
    known before the solver ever sees the file (bench/runners/generate_large_lp.py builds the
    instance BACKWARDS from a chosen primal-dual pair that already satisfies the KKT
    conditions, the same construction tests/oracles/lp_generator.cpp uses for the fuzz gate),
    solved by the GPU-story engine (restarted PDHG, CPU path) with --progress-out streaming
    live iteration progress to a file, exactly as an operator watching a long solve would use.

It CANNOT confirm no better answer exists - that is the whole content of the search, and a
branch and bound which wrongly fathoms a node returns a point that passes every such check.

    Stating these is the point. A solver that is vague about its limits is not one an
    industrial user can plan around.

    MIQP                Implemented: branch and bound with the convex QP engine as the node
                        solver. The caveat is the BOUND, and it is worth stating because it
                        is what limits the class. A simplex node bound is a vertex objective,
                        exact to rounding; a first-order QP node bound is only accurate to
                        the tolerance it converged to. Since branch and bound PRUNES on that
                        bound, and an optimistic bound can fathom the subtree holding the
                        optimum, the node tolerance is tightened to 1e-10 and the pruning
                        margin widened by the same amount rather than pruning on the
                        optimistic side. That is the safe direction and it costs nodes. With
                        root cuts off by default (#159) as well, expect MIQP to show the same
                        weakness the MIPLIB line below reports: incumbents found, optimality
                        proved on fewer.
    Non-convex QP       REFUSED, deliberately. src/qp/convexity.cpp decides semidefiniteness
                        of sense * Q by LDL^T before any arithmetic starts, and returns a
                        negative pivot as a certificate. A local optimum reported as a global
                        one is the failure mode we will not ship.
    Interior point      Implemented and OPT-IN (--option algorithm=ipm, issue #56): Mehrotra
                        predictor-corrector over a from-scratch sparse LDL^T. It produces no
                        basis, so it cannot warm-start branch and bound and cannot certify
                        infeasibility, and on the full Netlib set it verifies fewer instances
                        than the dual simplex. The default continuous engine stays the
                        simplex (exact, gives a basis); restarted PDHG is the first-order one.
    Cutting planes      EXIST, OFF BY DEFAULT. Root Gomory mixed-integer and lifted knapsack
                        cover cuts landed in #159 (--option enable_root_cuts=true), validity
                        gated against the exact rational optimum. Off because the A/B on the
                        30 MIPLIB instances at 60 s proves the same 9 either way, cuts nodes
                        to 0.918x, and costs one published match - noswot, -39 with cuts
                        against -41 without, because a cut row makes every node LP dearer
                        (bench/results/miplib-cuts-{off,on}.csv).
                        No MIR cuts, and none below the root. Branch and bound itself has
                        reliability branching (#69) and warm-starts every node LP in the
                        dual simplex (#65).
    GPU acceleration    ON MAIN, NOT YET MEASURED. The CUDA port of the first-order engine
                        (src/gpu/, #329 to #373) is on main and compiles in CI. It has not
                        run on a card, so there is no GPU number and no speed-up is claimed
                        until #19's CSV exists. --gpu on a build without CUDA warns and runs
                        on the CPU; on a CUDA build it falls back to the CPU when the device
                        fails its checks.
    Scale               Section 2.5 above solves one 5000 x 5000 instance, which is the
                        largest thing here by two orders of magnitude and is checked against
                        an optimum known by construction - but ONE generated instance is a
                        demonstration, not a benchmark, and it says nothing about the sparse
                        industrial structure real models have. Everything else here is small.
                        Nothing in this run supports a claim about the "millions of
                        variables" end of what the problem statement asks for; the measured
                        scale evidence is docs/BENCHMARKS.md sections 1f-1f.3, generated
                        instances with exact optima, and no real industrial model at that size.

                        THE HONEST HEADLINE IS THE FULL NETLIB SET - not the @NCOUNT@ solved
                        live above, and not the medium tier either:

                            full set, 89 instances:    @FULL@
                            medium tier, 50 instances: @MEDIUM@

                        Both counts are instances we solve AND independently verify, so they
                        are answers checked by something that shares no code with the solver,
                        not just runs that exited zero. As a RATE the medium tier looks the
                        better of the two, and that is exactly why it is not the headline:
                        the tier is defined by a 500-row cap, so it is the easier half by
                        construction, and quoting it would be choosing the denominator that
                        flatters us.

                        What the rest are is worth stating by name, read from the same CSV:

                            @FAILURES@

                        "published value differs" is, on this set, mostly Netlib's readme
                        being older than the instance files: on every such instance our
                        objective agrees with HiGHS (bench/runners/cross_check_highs.py), and
                        HiGHS disagrees with the readme by the same amount.

                        On size, read from the same CSV as the counts above:

                            @MIPLIB@
                        They are the weakest numbers in the project: branch and bound reaches
                        a feasible incumbent on most of the set but PROVES optimality on few.
                        Root cuts (#159) exist and are off by default because at 60 s they
                        prove no more and cost a published match; reliability branching
                        (#69) moved the count by one each way. Stated here rather than left
                        out - a reader who opens bench/results/ finds it either way, and #54
                        is the tracker.
    Parallelism         Single-threaded by default. --option threads=N runs an iteration's
                        column loops under OpenMP, deterministically (bit-identical results at
                        1 and 8 threads), and at Netlib scale it is measured to buy nothing:
                        an iteration is too short to amortize the fork (#57). A switch that
                        preserves correctness, not a speed claim.

    On speed against HiGHS, section 5 above prints the measured ratio for this run rather
    than repeating a number here that would go stale - and it is a narrow comparison either
    way: @NCOUNT@ small instances settle nothing about large models. HiGHS is a decade of
    specialist work, including a mature dual simplex, which we do not have. Presolve is no
    longer part of that gap: ours is in src/presolve and runs by default (#43).
    The claim we do make is narrower and checkable: on every instance we report as solved,
    the answer matches the published optimum AND survives an independent verifier that
    shares no code with the solver.
