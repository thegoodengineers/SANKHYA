"""Locating and loading the SANKHYA shared library, and declaring the C signatures.

WHY ctypes AND NOT pybind11. A compiled extension module has to be built against the exact
Python it will be imported by, which turns "use the solver from Python" into a second build
system, a wheel, and an ABI to keep matching. ctypes needs none of that: the shared library
the C++ build already produces is the whole dependency, and the same file works from CPython,
PyPy, and anything else with an FFI. It also means these bindings exercise
`include/sankhya/sankhya.h` exactly as a third-party caller would, so a defect in that
boundary shows up here rather than being papered over by a C++-aware binding layer.

EVERY SIGNATURE IS DECLARED. ctypes defaults to `int` for any return type it was not told
about, which silently truncates a pointer on 64-bit Windows and returns garbage for a double.
Declaring `restype` and `argtypes` for every function is not tidiness - it is the difference
between a wrong answer and a working one, and the failure would appear as an implausible
objective rather than as a crash.
