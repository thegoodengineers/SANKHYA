# =============================================================================================
# Issue #48: a row or column name containing a space is legal fixed-format MPS. Free-format
# tokenisation splits "DEDO3 1R" into two fields ("DEDO3", "1R"), shifting every field after it
# left by one - on the COLUMNS line below that turns the row name "OB1PNW20" into a value field,
# and float("OB1PNW20") raises exactly the error this issue reports. parse_mps() must retry the
# whole file in fixed columns when free-format tokenisation fails, and recover the real names.
#
# These lines are built at the exact 1-based IBM column positions (2-3, 5-12, 15-22, 25-36,
# 40-47, 50-61), the same positions FIXED_FIELDS in verify_solution.py encodes.
