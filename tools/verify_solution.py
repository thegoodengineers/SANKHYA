    python tools/verify_solution.py model.mps solution.sol

This script exists so that "our answer is correct" is something a judge can CHECK rather
than believe. Three rules make that real, and all three are load-bearing:

1.  IT LINKS NO PART OF OUR C++. Pure Python, reading the model and .sol file as text.

2.  IT PARSES THE MODEL ITSELF. verify_solution_mps.py is a second, independent
    implementation written from the IBM specification, reusing no interpretation of
    anything from src/io/mps_reader.cpp - a reader that shared its bugs with the solver
    would confirm them instead of catching them.

3.  IT RECOMPUTES EVERY NUMBER: activities, the objective, reduced costs, the dual objective - from (model, x, y), never read from the .sol header.

Split across five files by issue #262, none over ~600 lines: _mps.py and _sol.py are rule
2's readers, _checks.py holds the certificate/IIS/pool checks, _io.py is shared by both.
Exit codes:  0 every check passed   1 a check failed   2 could not read the inputs
