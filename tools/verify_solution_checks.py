       activities against row bounds, values against column bounds - and needs no solver.

    There is no point to test - that is the whole content of the verdict - so a checker that
    asks for one is asking the wrong question. What CAN be handed over is a Farkas
    certificate: one multiplier per row. Aggregating the rows with those weights produces a
    single inequality that every feasible point would have to satisfy, and the certificate is
    good exactly when no point in the column box satisfies it.

    Written out, with rows `row_lower <= a_i.x <= row_upper` and columns in `[l, u]`:

        a multiplier y_i > 0 uses the row's LOWER bound   (a_i.x >= row_lower[i])
        a multiplier y_i < 0 uses the row's UPPER bound   (a_i.x <= row_upper[i])

    so every feasible x satisfies  d.x >= S  where  d = A'y  and  S = sum_i y_i * (that
    bound). The largest d.x can be over the box is M, taking each column to whichever of its
    own bounds the sign of d_j prefers. If M < S the system has no feasible point at all.

    Two ways a certificate can be bogus, both checked rather than assumed: a multiplier that
    leans on a bound the row does not have (infinite), and a column free in the direction d
    prefers, which makes M infinite and proves nothing.
